DESSN Cosmology Analysis

This document should detail the code structure, examples, and all other goodies.



Examples
========

Learning from examples is my preferred method.

For the primary motivation example, explaining how the models work and tie together, and why
certain design choices have been chosen - primarily marginalisation over numerical integration, see the link below.


.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   dessn.examples.simple


For a different example, which shows how to use discrete parameters, see the link below.



.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   dessn.examples.discrete


To learn how the underlying models function, and specific details on the sorts of parameters and edges allowed,
see the link below.


.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   dessn.model


For examples and usage instructions on how to use the plotting library included in this project, see the link below.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   dessn.chain

Finally, for the toy model implementation, see the link below.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   dessn.toy



The general project structure is as follows:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 4

   dessn

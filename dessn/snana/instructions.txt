1. Go to location      /project/rkessler/shinton/sim
2. Run sim via         snlc_sim.exe SIMGEN_DES_SALT2_SAM.input > output.log &
3. Wait for sim to finish.
4. Copy dump file to directory    cp /project/rkessler/SN/SNDATA_ROOT/SIM/SHINTON_SPEC_SALT2/SHINTON_SPEC_SALT2.DUMP .
    4a. SHINTON_SPEC_SALT2_4 is the GENVERSION name in the .input
5. Put dump file in dessn/models/d_simple_stan/data/snana_dumps
6. split_and_fit.pl
6. Run convert_snana_dump.py in dessn/models/d_simple_stan



To generate the kcor files for the filter shifts:

kcor.exe /project/rkessler/SN/SNDATA_ROOT/kcor/DES/20130322/kcor_DES.input FILTER_LAMSHIFT g 1 OUTFILE ~/shinton/sim/kcor_des_gshift.fits
kcor.exe /project/rkessler/SN/SNDATA_ROOT/kcor/DES/20130322/kcor_DES.input FILTER_LAMSHIFT r 1 OUTFILE ~/shinton/sim/kcor_des_rshift.fits
kcor.exe /project/rkessler/SN/SNDATA_ROOT/kcor/DES/20130322/kcor_DES.input FILTER_LAMSHIFT i 1 OUTFILE ~/shinton/sim/kcor_des_ishift.fits
kcor.exe /project/rkessler/SN/SNDATA_ROOT/kcor/DES/20130322/kcor_DES.input FILTER_LAMSHIFT z 1 OUTFILE ~/shinton/sim/kcor_des_zshift.fits


For diff:

snlc_sim.exe DIFF_DES_SALT2_SAM.input && cp /project/rkessler/SN/SNDATA_ROOT/SIM/SHINTON_SPEC_SALT2_DIFF/SHINTON_SPEC_SALT2_DIFF.DUMP . && split_and_fit.pl DIFF_SNFIT_DES_SAM.NML

sim_SNmix.pl for simulating observations for multiple confs. Doesnt appear like theres a built in way to make snana use multicores for a single thread

snlc_sim.exe DIFF_SKEWED_DES_SALT2_SAM.input && cp /project/rkessler/SN/SNDATA_ROOT/SIM/SHINTON_SPEC_SALT2_DIFF_SKEWED/SHINTON_SPEC_SALT2_DIFF_SKEWED.DUMP . && split_and_fit.pl DIFF_SKEWED_SNFIT_DES_SAM.NML

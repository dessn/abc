\section{Introduction}


In the years since the discovery of the acceleration of our universe \citep{RiessFilippenko1998, SchmidtSuntzeff1998, PerlmutterAldering1999}, supernova cosmology continued to grow as an important cosmological probe. Recent supernova studies offer far greater statistical power than ever before, systematics are better understood, and the very phenomenon of supernova are described with improved models \citep{GuyAstier2007, ConleyGuy2011, BetouleKessler2014, RubinAldering2015}.

\section{Motivation}


SALT2 and other models

why summary stats are used (instead of light curve data)

fitting methodologies

highlight Previous studies using summary statistics and their data sets.

Assumed gaussianity.



\section{Methodology}

to investigate, go to lowest level and simulate light curves

to start with, realise only canonical supernova from abs mag with some scatter, using WMAP9 cosmology. Do this for shallow and deep fields, and fit the light curves using different methods.

state skewness introduced as z increases and ston decreases

which creates difference when between mean and max likelihood

section detailing the bias as a function of redshift (and ston if possible). 

\section{Cosmological Impact}

Fit cosmology against simulated SN

Do for des shallow and deep, using survey area to produce z dist plus extra low-z sample (0.05<z<0.2). simulate from light curves, apply selection effect of ston>5to cull bad fits. have <x> shallow.

toy cosmology model. adopt $\alpha$ and $\beta$ values for Phillips correction from Betoule2014, assume known gaussian intrinsic scatter, have $\Omega_m$, $w$ and $M_B$ as cosmology parameters - marginalise over $M_B$.

Show cosmology results.

The last numbered section should briefly summarise what has been done, and describe
the final conclusions which the authors draw from their work.

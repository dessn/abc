r""" An example used to prototype the inclusion of discrete observables into the mix.

The scenario being modelled is similar to the coloured balled example. Except now
we model the observed colour not as a single value, but as a discrete value with given
probabilities if the "colour" is close between the boundary of red and blue.

We *should* be modelling all observed colours as discrete, but only model some
provides a more rigorous test of the discrete framework.

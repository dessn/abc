@article{Abbott2016,
abstract = {This overview article describes the legacy prospect and discovery potential of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) beyond cosmological studies, illustrating it with examples from the DES early data. DES is using a wide-field camera (DECam) on the 4m Blanco Telescope in Chile to image 5000 sq deg of the sky in five filters (grizY). By its completion the survey is expected to have generated a catalogue of 300 million galaxies with photometric redshifts and 100 million stars. In addition, a time-domain survey search over 27 sq deg is expected to yield a sample of thousands of Type Ia supernovae and other transients. The main goals of DES are to characterise dark energy and dark matter, and to test alternative models of gravity; these goals will be pursued by studying large scale structure, cluster counts, weak gravitational lensing and Type Ia supernovae. However, DES also provides a rich data set which allows us to study many other aspects of astrophysics. In this paper we focus on additional science with DES, emphasizing areas where the survey makes a difference with respect to other current surveys. The paper illustrates, using early data (from `Science Verification', and from the first, second and third seasons of observations), what DES can tell us about the solar system, the Milky Way, galaxy evolution, quasars, and other topics. In addition, we show that if the cosmological model is assumed to be Lambda+ Cold Dark Matter (LCDM) then important astrophysics can be deduced from the primary DES probes. Highlights from DES early data include the discovery of 34 Trans Neptunian Objects, 17 dwarf satellites of the Milky Way, one published z {\textgreater} 6 quasar (and more confirmed) and two published superluminous supernovae (and more confirmed).},

abstract = {We present cosmological results from the final galaxy clustering data set of the Baryon Oscil-lation Spectroscopic Survey, part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III. Our combined galaxy sample comprises 1.2 million massive galaxies over an effective area of 9329 deg 2 and vol-ume of 18.7 Gpc 3 , divided into three partially overlapping redshift slices centred at effective redshifts 0.38, 0.51, and 0.61. We measure the angular diameter distance D M and Hubble parameter H from the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) method after applying reconstruc-tion to reduce non-linear effects on the BAO feature. Using the anisotropic clustering of the pre-reconstruction density field, we measure the product D M H from the Alcock-Paczynski (AP) effect and the growth of structure, quantified by f $\sigma$ 8 (z), from redshift-space distortions (RSD). We combine individual measurements presented in seven companion papers into a set of consensus values and likelihoods, obtaining constraints that are tighter and more robust than those from any one method; in particular, the AP measurement from sub-BAO scales sharpens constraints from post-reconstruction BAO by breaking degeneracy between D M and H. Combined with Planck 2015 cosmic microwave background measurements, our distance scale measurements simultaneously imply curvature Ω K = 0.0003 ± 0.0026 and a dark en-ergy equation of state parameter w = −1.01 ± 0.06, in strong affirmation of the spatially flat cold dark matter model with a cosmological constant ($\Lambda$CDM). Our RSD measurements of f $\sigma$ 8 , at 6 per cent precision, are similarly consistent with this model. When combined with supernova Ia data, we find H 0 = 67.3 ± 1.0 km s −1 Mpc −1 even for our most general dark energy model, in tension with some direct measurements. Adding extra relativistic species as a degree of freedom loosens the constraint only slightly, to H 0 = 67.8 ± 1.2 km s −1 Mpc −1 . Assuming flat $\Lambda$CDM we find Ω m = 0.310 ± 0.005 and H 0 = 67.6 ± 0.5 km s −1 Mpc −1 , and we find a 95{\%} upper limit of 0.16 eV/c 2 on the neutrino mass sum.},

abstract = {We report on work to increase the number of well-measured Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) at high redshifts. Light curves, including high signal-to-noise HST data, and spectra of six SNe Ia that were discovered during 2001 are presented. Additionally, for the two SNe with z{\textgreater}1, we present ground-based J-band photometry from Gemini and the VLT. These are among the most distant SNe Ia for which ground based near-IR observations have been obtained. We add these six SNe Ia together with other data sets that have recently become available in the literature to the Union compilation (Kowalski et al. 2008). We have made a number of refinements to the Union analysis chain, the most important ones being the refitting of all light curves with the SALT2 fitter and an improved handling of systematic errors. We call this new compilation, consisting of 557 supernovae, the Union2 compilation. The flat concordance LambdaCDM model remains an excellent fit to the Union2 data with the best fit constant equation of state parameter w=-0.997{\^{}}{\{}+0.050{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.054{\}} (stat) {\^{}}{\{}+0.077{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.082{\}} (stat+sys$\backslash$ together) for a flat universe, or w=-1.035{\^{}}{\{}+0.055{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.059{\}} (stat){\^{}}{\{}+0.093{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.097{\}} (stat+sys together) with curvature.

The strength of the constraints depend strongly on redshift. In particular, at z {\textgreater} 1, the existence and nature of dark energy are only weakly constrained by the data.},

Follow-up spectroscopy was performed at the VLT, Gemini and Keck telescopes to confirm the nature of the supernovae and to measure their redshift. With this data set, we have built a Hubble diagram extending to z=1, with all distance measurements involving at least two bands.

This homogeneous data set is used to test for redshift Met evolution of SN Ia spectra, and will be used in the SNLS 3rd year cosmological analyses. hods . Spectra have been reduced and extracted with a dedicated pipeline that uses photometric information from deep CFHT legacy survey (CFHT-LS) reference images to trace, at sub-pixel accuracy, the position of the supernova on the spectrogram as a function of wavelength. It also separates the supernova and its host light in ∼60{\%} of cases. The identification of the supernova Resul candidates is performed using a spectrophotometric SN Ia model. t s . A total of 124 SNe Ia, roughly 50{\%} of the overall SNLS spectroscopic sample, have been identified using the ESO/VLT during the first three years of the survey. Their redshifts range from z = 0.149 to z = 1.031. The average redshift of the sample is z = 0.63 ± 0.02. This constitutes the largest SN Ia spectral set to date in this redshift range. The spectra are presented along with their best-fit spectral SN Ia model and a host model where relevant. In the latter case, a host subtracted spectrum is also presented. We produce average spectra for pre-maximum, maximum and post-maximum epochs for both z {\textless} 0.5and z ≥ 0.5SNe Ia.We find that z {\textless} 0.5 spectra have deeper intermediate mass element absorptions than z ≥ 0.5 spectra. The differences with redshift are consistent with the selection of brighter and bluer supernovae at higher redshift.},

abstract = {We report a measurement of the Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) rate in galaxy clusters at 0.9 0.9 SNe. Finding 8 1 cluster SNe Ia, we determine a SN Ia rate of 0.50 +0.23-0.19 (stat) +0.10-0.09 (sys) SNuB (SNuB = 10 -12 SNe Lsun,B -1 yr -1). In units of stellar mass, this translates to 0.36 +0.16-0.13 (stat) +0.07-0.06 (sys) SNuM (SNuM = 10 -12 SNe Msun -1 yr -1). This represents a factor of approximately 5 2 increase over measurements of the cluster rate at z {\textless} 0.2. We parameterize the late-time SN Ia delay time distribution with a power law (proportional to t s). Under the assumption of a cluster formation redshift of zf = 3, our rate measurement in combination with lower-redshift cluster SN Ia rates constrains s = -1.31 +0.55-0.40, consistent with measurements of the delay time distribution in the field. This measurement is also consistent with the value of s {\~{}} -1 typically expected for the "double degenerate" SN Ia progenitor scenario, and inconsistent with some models for the "single degenerate" scenario predicting a steeper delay time distribution at large delay times. We check for environmental dependence and the influence of younger stellar populations by calculating the rate specifically in cluster red-sequence galaxies and in morphologically early-type galaxies, finding results similar to the full cluster rate. Finally, the upper limit of one host-less cluster SN Ia detected in the survey implies that the fraction of stars in the intra-cluster medium is less than 0.47 (95{\%} confidence), consistent with measurements at lower redshifts.},

abstract = {We present an analysis of supernova light curves simulated for the upcoming Dark Energy Survey (DES) supernova search. The simulations employ a code suite that generates and fits realistic light curves in order to obtain distance modulus/redshift pairs that are passed to a cosmology fitter. We investigated several different survey strategies including field selection, supernova selection biases, and photometric redshift measurements. Using the results of this study, we chose a 30 square degree search area in the griz filter set. We forecast 1) that this survey will provide a homogeneous sample of up to 4000 Type Ia supernovae in the redshift range 0.05{\textless}z{\textless}1.2, and 2) that the increased red efficiency of the DES camera will significantly improve high-redshift color measurements. The redshift of each supernova with an identified host galaxy will be obtained from spectroscopic observations of the host. A supernova spectrum will be obtained for a subset of the sample, which will be utilized for control studies. In addition, we have investigated the use of combined photometric redshifts taking into account data from both the host and supernova. We have investigated and estimated the likely contamination from core-collapse supernovae based on photometric identification, and have found that a Type Ia supernova sample purity of up to 98{\%} is obtainable given specific assumptions. Furthermore, we present systematic uncertainties due to sample purity, photometric calibration, dust extinction priors, filter-centroid shifts, and inter-calibration. We conclude by estimating the uncertainty on the cosmological parameters that will be measured from the DES supernova data.},

abstract = {We present cosmological constraints from a joint analysis of type Ia supernova (SN Ia) observations obtained by the SDSS-II and SNLS collaborations. The data set includes several low-redshift samples (z{\textless}0.1), all 3 seasons from the SDSS-II (0.05 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.4), and 3 years from SNLS (0.2 {\textless}z {\textless} 1) and totals $\backslash$ntotc spectroscopically confirmed type Ia supernovae with high quality light curves. We have followed the methods and assumptions of the SNLS 3-year data analysis except for the following important improvements: 1) the addition of the full SDSS-II spectroscopically-confirmed SN Ia sample in both the training of the SALT2 light curve model and in the Hubble diagram analysis ($\backslash$nsdssc SNe), 2) inter-calibration of the SNLS and SDSS surveys and reduced systematic uncertainties in the photometric calibration, performed blindly with respect to the cosmology analysis, and 3) a thorough investigation of systematic errors associated with the SALT2 modeling of SN Ia light-curves. We produce recalibrated SN Ia light-curves and associated distances for the SDSS-II and SNLS samples. The large SDSS-II sample provides an effective, independent, low-z anchor for the Hubble diagram and reduces the systematic error from calibration systematics in the low-z SN sample. For a flat LCDM cosmology we find Omega{\_}m=0.295+-0.034 (stat+sys), a value consistent with the most recent CMB measurement from the Planck and WMAP experiments. Our result is 1.8sigma (stat+sys) different than the previously published result of SNLS 3-year data. The change is due primarily to improvements in the SNLS photometric calibration. When combined with CMB constraints, we measure a constant dark-energy equation of state parameter w=-1.018+-0.057 (stat+sys) for a flat universe. Adding BAO distance measurements gives similar constraints: w=-1.027+-0.055.},
annote = {Recent supernova (SN) cosmological measurements have greatly reduced both the statistical and systematic uncertainty in our knowledge of the accelerated expansion of the universe (the latest such efforts are presented in Suzuki et al. 2012; Betoule et al. 2014; Rest et al. 2014)

As the size of the SN Ia sample grows, so does the importance of systematic errors relative to statistical errors, to the point where current measurements of the cosmological parameters (including properties of dark energy) are limited by systematics (Betoule et al. 2014).

With spectroscopically confirmed SN Ia samples, the effect from biases has been evaluated in recent analyses (Conley et al. 2011; Betoule et al. 2014; Scolnic et al. 2014a)},

abstract = {Stan is a probabilistic programming language for specifying statistical models. A Stan program imperatively defines a log probability function over parameters conditioned on specified data and constants. As of version 2.14.0, Stan provides full Bayesian inference for continuous-variable models through Markov chain Monte Carlo methods such as the No-U-Turn sampler, an adaptive form of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling. Penalized maximum likelihood estimates are calculated using optimization methods such as the limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. Stan is also a platform for computing log densities and their gradients and Hessians, which can be used in alternative algorithms such as variational Bayes, expectation propagation, and marginal inference using approximate integration. To this end, Stan is set up so that the densities, gradients, and Hessians, along with intermediate quantities of the algorithm such as acceptance probabilities, are easily accessible. Stan can be called from the command line using the cmdstan package, through R using the rstan package, and through Python using the pystan package. All three interfaces support sampling and optimization-based inference with diagnostics and posterior analysis. rstan and pystan also provide access to log probabilities, gradients, Hessians, parameter transforms, and specialized plotting.},

abstract = {We derive empirical models for galaxy mass assembly histories, and convolve these with theoretical delay time distribution (DTD) models for Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) to derive the distribution of progenitor ages for all SNe Ia occurring at a given epoch of cosmic time. In actively star-forming galaxies, the progression of the star formation rate is shallower than a {\$}t{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} SN Ia DTD, so mean SN Ia ages peak at the DTD peak in all star-forming galaxies at all epochs of cosmic history. In passive galaxies which have ceased star formation through some quenching process, the SN Ia age distribution peaks at the quenching epoch, which in passive galaxies evolves in redshift to track the past epoch of major star formation. Our models reproduce the SN Ia rate evolution in redshift, the relationship between SN Ia stretch and host mass, and the distribution of SN Ia host masses in a manner qualitatively consistent with observations. Our model naturally predicts that low-mass galaxies tend to be actively star-forming while massive galaxies are generally passive, consistent with observations of galaxy "downsizing". Consequently, the mean ages of SNe Ia undergo a sharp transition from young ages at low host mass to old ages at high host mass, qualitatively similar to the transition of mean SN Ia Hubble residuals with host mass. The age discrepancy evolves with redshift in a manner currently not accounted for in SN Ia cosmology analyses. We thus suggest that SNe Ia selected only from actively star-forming galaxies will yield the most cosmologically uniform sample, due to the homogeneity of young SN Ia progenitor ages at all cosmological epochs.},

abstract = {We employ 76 type Ia supernovae with optical spectrophotometry within 2.5 days of B-band maximum light obtained by the Nearby Supernova Factory to derive the impact of Si and Ca features on supernovae intrinsic luminosity and determine a dust reddening law. We use the equivalent width of Si II {\{}$\backslash$lambda{\}}4131 in place of light curve stretch to account for first-order intrinsic luminosity variability. The resultant empirical spectral reddening law exhibits strong features associated with Ca II and Si II {\{}$\backslash$lambda{\}}6355. After applying a correction based on the Ca II H{\&}K equivalent width we find a reddening law consistent with a Cardelli extinction law. Using the same input data, we compare this result to synthetic rest-frame UBVRI-like photometry in order to mimic literature observations. After corrections for signatures correlated with Si II {\{}$\backslash$lambda{\}}4131 and Ca II H{\&}K equivalent widths, and introducing an empirical correlation between colors, we determine the dust component in each band. We find a value of the total-to-selective extinction ratio, RV = 2.8 $\backslash$pm 0.3. This agrees with the Milky Way value, in contrast to the low RV values found in most previous analyses. This result suggests that the long-standing controversy in interpreting SN Ia colors and their compatibility with a classical extinction law, critical to their use as cosmological probes, can be explained by the treatment of the dispersion in colors, and by the variability of features apparent in SN Ia spectra.},

We pay particular attention to systematic uncertainties, characterizing them using a systematics covariance matrix that incorporates the redshift dependence of these effects, as well as the shape-luminosity and color-luminosity relationships. Unlike previous work, we include the effects of systematic terms on the empirical light-curve models. The total systematic uncertainty is dominated by calibration terms. We describe how the systematic uncertainties can be reduced with soon to be available improved nearby and intermediate-redshift samples, particularly those calibrated onto USNO/SDSS-like systems.},

Both the old and new techniques can handle correlations due to systematic uncertainties (such as correlated peculiar velocities and photometric calibration uncertainties), assuming the sizes of these uncertainties are known.15 The modifications to the old framework to include correlations are detailed in Kowalski et al. (2008), Amanullah et al. (2010), Guy et al. (2010) and Conley et al. (2011)

abstract = {We examine the correlation between supernova host galaxy properties and their residuals on the Hubble diagram. We use supernovae discovered during the Sloan Digital Sky Survey II - Supernova Survey, and focus on objects at a redshift of z {\textless} 0.15, where the selection effects of the survey are known to yield a complete Type Ia supernova sample. To minimize the bias in our analysis with respect to measured host-galaxy properties, spectra were obtained for nearly all hosts, spanning a range in magnitude of -23 {\textless} M{\_}r {\textless} -17. In contrast to previous works that use photometric estimates of host mass as a proxy for global metallicity, we analyze host-galaxy spectra to obtain gas-phase metallicities and star-formation rates from host galaxies with active star formation. From a final sample of {\~{}} 40 emission-line galaxies, we find that light-curve corrected Type Ia supernovae are {\~{}} 0.1 magnitudes brighter in high-metallicity hosts than in low-metallicity hosts. We also find a significant ({\textgreater} 3{\{}$\backslash$sigma{\}}) correlation between the Hubble residuals of Type Ia supernovae and the specific star-formation rate of the host galaxy. We comment on the importance of supernova/host-galaxy correlations as a source of systematic bias in future deep supernova surveys.},

We combine three two-point functions: (i) the cosmic shear correlation function of 26 million source galaxies in four redshift bins, (ii) the galaxy angular autocorrelation function of 650,000 luminous red galaxies in five redshift bins, and (iii) the galaxy-shear cross-correlation of luminous red galaxy positions and source galaxy shears. To demonstrate the robustness of these results, we use independent pairs of galaxy shape, photometric redshift estimation and validation, and likelihood analysis pipelines. To prevent confirmation bias, the bulk of the analysis was carried out while blind to the true results; we describe an extensive suite of systematics checks performed and passed during this blinded phase. The data are modeled in flat {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM and {\$}w{\$}CDM cosmologies, marginalizing over 20 nuisance parameters, varying 6 (for {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM) or 7 (for {\$}w{\$}CDM) cosmological parameters including the neutrino mass density and including the 457 {\$}\backslashtimes{\$} 457 element analytic covariance matrix.

We use a maximum likelihood method to fit SN rate models to the SDSS-II Supernova Survey data in combination with other rate measurements, thereby constraining models for the redshift-evolution of the SN Ia rate. Fitting the combined data to a simple power-law evolution of the volumetric SN Ia rate, {\$}r{\_}V \backslashpropto (1+z){\^{}}{\{}\backslashbeta{\}}{\$}, we obtain a value of {\$}\backslashbeta = 1.5 \backslashpm 0.6{\$}, i.e. the SN Ia rate is determined to be an increasing function of redshift at the {\$}\backslashsim 2.5 \backslashsigma{\$} level.

abstract = {Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques are now widely used for cosmological parameter estimation. Chains are generated to sample the posterior probability distribution obtained following the Bayesian approach. An important issue is how to optimize the efficiency of such sampling and how to diagnose whether a finite-length chain has adequately sampled the underlying posterior probability distribution. We show how the power spectrum of a single such finite chain may be used as a convergence diagnostic by means of a fitting function, and discuss strategies for optimizing the distribution for the proposed steps. The methods developed are applied to current CMB and LSS data interpreted using both a pure adiabatic cosmological model and a mixed adiabatic/isocurvature cosmological model including possible correlations between modes. For the latter application, because of the increased dimensionality and the presence of degeneracies, the need for tuning MCMC methods for maximum efficiency becomes particularly acute.},

We quantify and correct spurious correlations induced by spatially variable survey properties, testing their impact on the clustering measurements and covariance. We demonstrate the sample's robustness by testing for stellar contamination, for potential biases that could arise from the systematic correction, and for the consistency between the two-point auto- and cross-correlation functions. We show that the corrections we apply have a significant impact on the resultant measurement of cosmological parameters, but that the results are robust against arbitrary choices in the correction method. We find the linear galaxy bias in each redshift bin in a fiducial cosmology to be {\$}b(z{\$}={\$}0.24)=1.40 \backslashpm 0.08{\$}, {\$}b(z{\$}={\$}0.38)=1.61 \backslashpm 0.05{\$}, {\$}b(z{\$}={\$}0.53)=1.60 \backslashpm 0.04{\$} for galaxies with luminosities {\$}L/L{\_}*{\textgreater}{\$}{\$}0.5{\$}, {\$}b(z{\$}={\$}0.68)=1.93 \backslashpm 0.05{\$} for {\$}L/L{\_}*{\textgreater}{\$}{\$}1{\$} and {\$}b(z{\$}={\$}0.83)=1.99 \backslashpm 0.07{\$} for {\$}L/L{\_}*{\$}{\$}{\textgreater}1.5{\$}, broadly consistent with expectations for the redshift and luminosity dependence of the bias of red galaxies.

abstract = {We present the analysis of the first set of low-redshift Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) by the Carnegie Supernova Project. Well-sampled, high-precision optical (ugriBV) and near-infrared (NIR; YJHKs) light curves obtained in a well-understood photometric system are used to provide light-curve parameters, and ugriBVYJH template light curves. The intrinsic colors at maximum light are calibrated to compute optical--NIR color excesses for the full sample, thus allowing the properties of the reddening law in the host galaxies to be studied. A low value of Rv{\~{}}1.7, is derived when using the entire sample of SNe. However, when the two highly reddened SNe in the sample are excluded, a value Galactic standard of Rv{\~{}}3.2 is obtained. The colors of these two events are well matched by a reddening model due to circumstellar dust. The peak luminosities are calibrated using a two-parameter linear fit to the decline rates and the colors, or alternatively, the color excesses. In both cases, dispersions in absolute magnitude of 0.12--0.16 mag are obtained, depending on the filter-color combination. In contrast to the results obtained from color excesses, these fits give Rv{\~{}}1--2, even when the two highly reddened SNe are excluded. This discrepancy suggests that, beyond the "normal" interstellar reddening produced in the host galaxies, there is an intrinsic dispersion in the colors of SNe Ia which is correlated with luminosity but independent of the decline rate. Finally, a Hubble diagram is produced by combining the results of the fits for each filter. The resulting scatter of 0.12 mag appears to be limited by peculiar velocities as evidenced by the strong correlation between the distance-modulus residuals among the different filters. The implication is that the actual precision of SN Ia distances is 3--4{\%}.},

abstract = {Recently, using a large low-redshift sample of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), we discovered a relation between SN Ia ejecta velocity and intrinsic color that improves the distance precision of SNe Ia and reduces potential systematic biases related to dust reddening. No SN Ia cosmological results have yet made a correction for the "velocity-color" relation. To test the existence of such a relation and constrain its properties at high redshift, we examine a sample of 75 SNe Ia discovered and observed by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-II (SDSS-II) Supernova Survey and Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS). From each spectrum, we measure ejecta velocities at maximum brightness for the Ca H{\&}K and Si II 6355 features, v{\_}Ca{\^{}}0 and v{\_}Si{\^{}}0, respectively. Using SN light-curve parameters, we determine the intrinsic B{\_}max - V{\_}max for each SN. Similar to what was found at low-redshift, we find that SNe Ia with higher ejecta velocity tend to be intrinsically redder than SNe Ia with lower ejecta velocity. The distributions of ejecta velocities for SNe Ia at low and high redshift are similar, indicating that current cosmological results should have little bias related to the velocity-color relation. Additionally, we find a slight (2.4-sigma significant) trend between SN Ia ejecta velocity and host-galaxy mass such that SNe Ia in high-mass host galaxies tend to have lower ejecta velocities as probed by v{\_}Ca{\^{}}0. These results emphasize the importance of spectroscopy for SN Ia cosmology.},

abstract = {We use a sample of 121 spectroscopically normal Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) to show that their intrinsic color is correlated with their ejecta velocity, as measured from the blueshift of the Si II 6355 feature near maximum brightness, v{\_}Si. The SN Ia sample was originally used by Wang et al. (2009) to show that the relationship between color excess and peak magnitude, which in the absence of intrinsic color differences describes a reddening law, was different for two subsamples split by v{\_}Si (defined as "Normal" and "High-Velocity"). We verify this result, but find that the two subsamples have the same reddening law when extremely reddened events (E(B-V) {\textgreater} 0.35 mag) are excluded. We also show that (1) the High-Velocity subsample is offset by {\~{}}0.06 mag to the red from the Normal subsample in the (B{\_}max - V{\_}max) - M{\_}V plane, (2) the B{\_}max - V{\_}max cumulative distribution functions of the two subsamples have nearly identical shapes, but the High-Velocity subsample is offset by {\~{}}0.07 mag to the red in B{\_}max - V{\_}max, and (3) the bluest High-Velocity SNe Ia are {\~{}}0.10 mag redder than the bluest Normal SNe Ia. Together, this evidence indicates a difference in intrinsic color for the subsamples. Accounting for this intrinsic color difference reduces the scatter in Hubble residuals from 0.190 mag to 0.130 mag for SNe Ia with A{\_}V {\textless} 0.7 mag. The scatter can be further reduced to 0.109 mag by exclusively using SNe Ia from the Normal subsample. Additionally, this result can at least partially explain the anomalously low values of R{\_}V found in large SN Ia samples. We explain the correlation between ejecta velocity and color as increased line blanketing in the High-Velocity SNe Ia, causing them to become redder. We discuss some implications of this result, and stress the importance of spectroscopy for future SN Ia cosmology surveys, with particular focus on the design of WFIRST.},

The algorithm behind emcee has several advantages over traditional MCMC sampling methods and it has excellent performance as measured by the autocorrelation time (or function calls per independent sample). One major advantage of the algorithm is that it requires hand-tuning of only 1 or 2 parameters compared to {\$}\backslashsim N{\^{}}2{\$} for a traditional algorithm in an N-dimensional parameter space.

abstract = {The Carnegie Supernova Project (CSP) is designed to measure the luminosity distance for Type Ia supernovae$\backslash$r$\backslash$n(SNe Ia) as a function of redshift, and to set observational constraints on the dark energy contribution to the$\backslash$r$\backslash$ntotal energy content of the universe. The CSP differs from other projects to date in its goal of providing an$\backslash$r$\backslash$nI-band rest-frame Hubble diagram. Here, we present the first results from near-infrared observations obtained$\backslash$r$\backslash$nusing the Magellan Baade telescope for SNe Ia with 0.1 {\textless}z{\textless} 0.7. We combine these results with those$\backslash$r$\backslash$nfrom the low-redshift CSP at z {\textless} 0.1. In this paper, we describe the overall goals of this long-term program,$\backslash$r$\backslash$nthe observing strategy, data reduction procedures, and treatment of systematic uncertainties. We present light$\backslash$r$\backslash$ncurves and an I-band Hubble diagram for this first sample of 35 SNe Ia, and we compare these data to$\backslash$r$\backslash$n21 new SNe Ia at low redshift. These data support the conclusion that the expansion of the universe is$\backslash$r$\backslash$naccelerating. When combined with independent results from baryon acoustic oscillations, these data yield$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\Omega$m = 0.27 ± 0.02(statistical) and $\Omega$DE = 0.76 ± 0.13(statistical) ± 0.09(systematic), for the matter and dark$\backslash$r$\backslash$nenergy densities, respectively. If we parameterize the data in terms of an equation of state, w (with no time$\backslash$r$\backslash$ndependence), assume a flat geometry, and combine with baryon acoustic oscillations, we find that w = −1.05 ±$\backslash$r$\backslash$n0.13(statistical) ± 0.09(systematic). The largest source of systematic uncertainty on w arises from uncertainties$\backslash$r$\backslash$nin the photometric calibration, signaling the importance of securing more accurate photometric calibrations for$\backslash$r$\backslash$nfuture supernova cosmology programs. Finally, we conclude that either the dust affecting the luminosities of SNe$\backslash$r$\backslash$nIa has a different extinction law (RV = 1.8) than that in the Milky Way (where RV = 3.1), or that there is an$\backslash$r$\backslash$nadditional intrinsic color term with luminosity for SNe Ia, independent of the decline rate. Understanding and$\backslash$r$\backslash$ndisentangling these effects is critical for minimizing the systematic uncertainties in future SN Ia cosmology studies.},

Using the Advanced Camera for Surveys and the Wide Field Camera 3 on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), we have imaged 25 galaxy-cluster fields and parallel fields of non-cluster galaxies. We report a sample of 27 SNe discovered in the parallel fields. Of these SNe, {\~{}}13 are classified as SN Ia candidates, including four SN Ia candidates at redshifts z {\textgreater} 1.2. We measure volumetric SN Ia rates to redshift 1.8 and add the first upper limit on the SN Ia rate in the range 1.8 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.4. The results are consistent with the rates measured by the HST/GOODS and Subaru Deep Field SN surveys. We model these results together with previous measurements at z {\textless} 1 from the literature. The best-fitting SN Ia delay-time distribution (DTD; the distribution of times that elapse between a short burst of star formation and subsequent SN Ia explosions) is a power law with an index of -1.00 +0.06(0.09) -0.06(0.10) (statistical) +0.12 -0.08 (systematic), where the statistical uncertainty is a result of the 68{\%} and 95{\%} (in parentheses) statistical uncertainties reported for the various SN Ia rates (from this work and from the literature), and the systematic uncertainty reflects the range of possible cosmic star-formation histories. We also test DTD models produced by an assortment of published binary population synthesis (BPS) simulations. The shapes of all BPS double-degenerate DTDs are consistent with the volumetric SN Ia measurements, when the DTD models are scaled up by factors of 3-9. In contrast, all BPS single-degenerate DTDs are ruled out by the measurements at a {\textgreater}99{\%} significance level.},

These events were detected and their multi-colour light curves measured using the MegaPrime/MegaCam instrument at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT), by repeatedly imaging four one-square degree fields in four bands. Follow-up spectroscopy was performed at the VLT, Gemini and Keck telescopes to confirm the nature of the supernovae and to measure their redshifts. Systematic uncertainties arising from light curve modeling are studied, making use of two techniques to derive the peak magnitude, shape and colour of the supernovae, and taking advantage of a precise calibration of the SNLS fields. A flat LambdaCDM cosmological fit to 231 SNLS high redshift Type Ia supernovae alone gives Omega{\_}M = 0.211 +/- 0.034(stat) +/- 0.069(sys). The dominant systematic uncertainty comes from uncertainties in the photometric calibration. Systematic uncertainties from light curve fitters come next with a total contribution of +/- 0.026 on Omega{\_}M. No clear evidence is found for a possible evolution of the slope (beta) of the colour-luminosity relation with redshift.},

abstract = {Aims. We present an empirical model of type Ia supernovae spectro-photometric evolution with time. Methods. The model is built using a large data set including light-curves and spectra of both nearby and distant supernovae, the latter being observed by the SNLS collaboration. We derive the average spectral sequence of type Ia supernovae and their main variability components including a color variation law. The model allows us to measure distance moduli in the spectral range 2500−8000 {\AA} with calculable uncertainties, including those arising from variability of spectral features. Results. Thanks to the use of high-redshift SNe to model the rest-frame UV spectral energy distribution, we are able to derive improved distance estimates for SNe Ia in the redshift range 0.8 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.1. The model can also be used to improve spectroscopic identification algorithms, and derive photometric redshifts of distant type Ia supernovae.},

abstract = {We present multi-band photometry of 185 type-Ia supernovae (SN Ia), with over 11500 observations. These were acquired between 2001 and 2008 at the F. L. Whipple Observatory of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA). This sample contains the largest number of homogeneously-observed and reduced nearby SN Ia (z {\textless} 0.08) published to date. It more than doubles the nearby sample, bringing SN Ia cosmology to the point where systematic uncertainties dominate. Our natural system photometry has a precision of 0.02 mag or better in BVRIr'i' and roughly 0.04 mag in U for points brighter than 17.5 mag. We also estimate a systematic uncertainty of 0.03 mag in our SN Ia standard system BVRIr'i' photometry and 0.07 mag for U. Comparisons of our standard system photometry with published SN Ia light curves and comparison stars, where available for the same SN, reveal agreement at the level of a few hundredths mag in most cases. We find that 1991bg-like SN Ia are sufficiently distinct from other SN Ia in their color and light-curve-shape/luminosity relation that they should be treated separately in light-curve/distance fitter training samples. The CfA3 sample will contribute to the development of better light-curve/distance fitters, particularly in the few dozen cases where near-infrared photometry has been obtained and, together, can help disentangle host-galaxy reddening from intrinsic supernova color, reducing the systematic uncertainty in SN Ia distances due to dust.},

There are a total of 5522 light curve points. We show that our natural system SN photometry has a precision of roughly 0.03 mag or better in BVr'i', 0.06 mag in u', and 0.07 mag in U for points brighter than 17.5 mag and estimate that it has a systematic uncertainty of 0.014, 0.010, 0.012, 0.014, 0.046, and 0.073 mag in BVr'i'u'U, respectively. Comparisons of our standard system photometry with published SN Ia light curves and comparison stars reveal mean agreement across samples in the range of {\~{}}0.00-0.03 mag. We discuss the recent measurements of our telescope-plus-detector throughput by direct monochromatic illumination by Cramer et al (in prep.). This technique measures the whole optical path through the telescope, auxiliary optics, filters, and detector under the same conditions used to make SN measurements. Extremely well-characterized natural-system passbands (both in wavelength and over time) are crucial for the next generation of SN Ia photometry to reach the 0.01 mag accuracy level. The current sample of low-z SN Ia is now sufficiently large to remove most of the statistical sampling error from the dark energy error budget. But pursuing the dark-energy systematic errors by determining highly-accurate detector passbands, combining optical and near-infrared (NIR) photometry and spectra, using the nearby sample to illuminate the population properties of SN Ia, and measuring the local departures from the Hubble flow will benefit from larger, carefully measured nearby samples.},

The CfA3 sample is added to the Union set of Kowalski et al. (2008) to form the Constitution set and, combined with a BAO prior, produces 1+w=0.013 +0.066/-0.068 (0.11 syst), consistent with the cosmological constant. The CfA3 addition makes the cosmologically-useful sample of nearby SN Ia between 2.6 and 2.9 times larger than before, reducing the statistical uncertainty to the point where systematics play the largest role. We use four light curve fitters to test for systematic differences: SALT, SALT2, MLCS2k2 (R{\_}V=3.1), and MLCS2k2 (R{\_}V=1.7). SALT produces high-redshift Hubble residuals with systematic trends versus color and larger scatter than MLCS2k2. MLCS2k2 overestimates the intrinsic luminosity of SN Ia with 0.7 {\textless} Delta {\textless} 1.2. MLCS2k2 with R{\_}V=3.1 overestimates host-galaxy extinction while R{\_}V=1.7 does not. Our investigation is consistent with no Hubble bubble. We also find that, after light-curve correction, SN Ia in Scd/Sd/Irr hosts are intrinsically fainter than those in E/S0 hosts by 2 sigma, suggesting that they may come from different populations. We also find that SN Ia in Scd/Sd/Irr hosts have low scatter (0.1 mag) and reddening. Current systematic errors can be reduced by improving SN Ia photometric accuracy, by including the CfA3 sample to retrain light-curve fitters, by combining optical SN Ia photometry with near-infrared photometry to understand host-galaxy extinction, and by determining if different environments give rise to different intrinsic SN Ia luminosity after correction for light-curve shape and color.},

abstract = {We present cosmological parameter constraints based on the final nine-year WMAP data, in conjunction with additional cosmological data sets. The WMAP data alone, and in combination, continue to be remarkably well fit by a six-parameter LCDM model. When WMAP data are combined with measurements of the high-l CMB anisotropy, the BAO scale, and the Hubble constant, the densities, Omegabh2, Omegach2, and Omega{\_}L, are each determined to a precision of {\~{}}1.5{\%}. The amplitude of the primordial spectrum is measured to within 3{\%}, and there is now evidence for a tilt in the primordial spectrum at the 5sigma level, confirming the first detection of tilt based on the five-year WMAP data. At the end of the WMAP mission, the nine-year data decrease the allowable volume of the six-dimensional LCDM parameter space by a factor of 68,000 relative to pre-WMAP measurements. We investigate a number of data combinations and show that their LCDM parameter fits are consistent. New limits on deviations from the six-parameter model are presented, for example: the fractional contribution of tensor modes is limited to r{\textless}0.13 (95{\%} CL); the spatial curvature parameter is limited to -0.0027 (+0.0039/-0.0038); the summed mass of neutrinos is {\textless}0.44 eV (95{\%} CL); and the number of relativistic species is found to be 3.84+/-0.40 when the full data are analyzed. The joint constraint on Neff and the primordial helium abundance agrees with the prediction of standard Big Bang nucleosynthesis. We compare recent PLANCK measurements of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect with our seven-year measurements, and show their mutual agreement. Our analysis of the polarization pattern around temperature extrema is updated. This confirms a fundamental prediction of the standard cosmological model and provides a striking illustration of acoustic oscillations and adiabatic initial conditions in the early universe.},

abstract = {Supernova cosmology without spectroscopic confirmation is an exciting new frontier which we address here with the Bayesian Estimation Applied to Multiple Species (BEAMS) algorithm and the full three years of data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey II Supernova Survey (SDSS-II SN). BEAMS is a Bayesian framework for using data from multiple species in statistical inference when one has the probability that each data point belongs to a given species, corresponding in this context to different types of supernovae with their probabilities derived from their multi-band lightcurves. We run the BEAMS algorithm on both Gaussian and more realistic SNANA simulations with of order 10{\^{}}4 supernovae, testing the algorithm against various pitfalls one might expect in the new and somewhat uncharted territory of photometric supernova cosmology. We compare the performance of BEAMS to that of both mock spectroscopic surveys and photometric samples which have been cut using typical selection criteria. The latter typically are either biased due to contamination or have significantly larger contours in the cosmological parameters due to small data-sets. We then apply BEAMS to the 792 SDSS-II photometric supernovae with host spectroscopic redshifts. In this case, BEAMS reduces the area of the ({\O}mega{\_}m,{\O}mega{\_}$\backslash$Lambda) contours by a factor of three relative to the case where only spectroscopically confirmed data are used (297 supernovae). In the case of flatness, the constraints obtained on the matter density applying BEAMS to the photometric SDSS-II data are {\O}mega{\_}m(BEAMS)=0.194$\backslash$pm0.07. This illustrates the potential power of BEAMS for future large photometric supernova surveys such as LSST.},

abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that avoids the random walk behavior and sensitivity to correlated parameters that plague many MCMC methods by taking a series of steps informed by first-order gradient information. These features allow it to converge to high-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than simpler methods such as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs sampling. However, HMC's performance is highly sensitive to two user-specified parameters: a step size {\{}$\backslash$epsilon{\}} and a desired number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm exhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large the algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an extension to HMC that eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. NUTS uses a recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points that spans a wide swath of the target distribution, stopping automatically when it starts to double back and retrace its steps. Empirically, NUTS perform at least as efficiently as and sometimes more efficiently than a well tuned standard HMC method, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. We also derive a method for adapting the step size parameter {\{}$\backslash$epsilon{\}} on the fly based on primal-dual averaging. NUTS can thus be used with no hand-tuning at all. NUTS is also suitable for applications such as BUGS-style automatic inference engines that require efficient "turnkey" sampling algorithms.},

Evidence for dark energy, the new component that causes the acceleration, has since become extremely strong, owing to an impressive variety of increasingly precise measurements of the expansion history and the growth of structure in the universe. Still, one of the central challenges of modern cosmology is to shed light on the physical mechanism behind the accelerating universe. In this review, we briefly summarize the developments that led to the discovery of dark energy. Next, we discuss the parametric descriptions of dark energy and the cosmological tests that allow us to better understand its nature. We then review the cosmological probes of dark energy. For each probe, we briefly discuss the physics behind it and its prospects for measuring dark energy properties. We end with a summary of the current status of dark energy research.},

abstract = {Peculiar velocities of objects in the nearby universe are correlated due to the gravitational pull of large-scale structure. By measuring these velocities, we have a unique opportunity to test the cosmological model at the lowest redshifts. We perform this test, using current data to constrain the amplitude of the "signal" covariance matrix describing the velocities and their correlations. We consider a new, well-calibrated "Supercal" set of low-redshift SNe Ia as well as a set of distances derived from the fundamental plane relation of 6dFGS galaxies. Analyzing the SN and galaxy data separately, both results are consistent with the peculiar velocity signal of our fiducial {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM model, ruling out the noise-only model with zero peculiar velocities at greater than {\$}7\backslashsigma{\$} (SNe) and {\$}8\backslashsigma{\$} (galaxies). When the two data sets are combined appropriately, the precision of the test increases slightly, resulting in a constraint on the signal amplitude of {\$}A = 1.05{\_}{\{}-0.21{\}}{\^{}}{\{}+0.25{\}}{\$}, where {\$}A = 1{\$} corresponds to our fiducial model.

A vast array of science will be enabled by a single wide-deep-fast sky survey, and LSST will have unique survey capability in the faint time domain. The LSST design is driven by four main science themes: probing dark energy and dark matter, taking an inventory of the Solar System, exploring the transient optical sky, and mapping the Milky Way. LSST will be a wide-field ground-based system designed to obtain multiple images covering the sky visible from Cerro Pach$\backslash$'{\{}o{\}}n in northern Chile. The telescope will have an 8.4 m (6.5 m effective) primary mirror, a 9.6 deg{\$}{\^{}}2{\$} field of view, and a 3.2 Gigapixel camera. This system can image about 10,000 square degrees of sky in three clear nights using pairs of 15-second exposures twice per night, with typical 5{\$}\backslashsigma{\$} depth for point sources of {\$}r\backslashsim24.5{\$} (AB). The project is in the construction phase and will begin regular survey operations by 2022. The survey area will be contained within 30,000 deg{\$}{\^{}}2{\$} with {\$}\backslashdelta{\textless}+34.5{\^{}}\backslashcirc{\$}, and will be imaged multiple times in six bands, {\$}ugrizy{\$}, covering the wavelength range 320--1050 nm.

The remaining 10$\backslash${\%} of the observing time will be allocated to projects such as a Very Deep and Fast time domain survey.

abstract = {Cosmological parameter estimation techniques that robustly account for systematic measurement uncertainties will be crucial for the next generation of cosmological surveys. We present a new analysis method, superABC, for obtaining cosmological constraints from Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) light curves using Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) without any likelihood assumptions. The ABC method works by using a forward model simulation of the data where systematic uncertainties can be simulated and marginalized over. A key feature of the method presented here is the use of two distinct metrics, the `Tripp' and `Light Curve' metrics, which allow us to compare the simulated data to the observed data set. The Tripp metric takes as input the parameters of models fit to each light curve with the SALT-II method, whereas the Light Curve metric uses the measured fluxes directly without model fitting. We apply the superABC sampler to a simulated data set of {\$}\backslashsim{\$}1000 SNe corresponding to the first season of the Dark Energy Survey Supernova Program. Varying {\$}\backslashOmega{\_}m, w{\_}0, \backslashalpha{\$} and {\$}\backslashbeta{\$} and a magnitude offset parameter, with no systematics we obtain {\$}\backslashDelta(w{\_}0) = w{\_}0{\^{}}{\{}\backslashrm true{\}} - w{\_}0{\^{}}{\{}\backslashrm best \backslash, fit{\}} = -0.036\backslashpm0.109{\$} (a {\$}\backslashsim11{\$}{\%} 1{\$}\backslashsigma{\$} uncertainty) using the Tripp metric and {\$}\backslashDelta(w{\_}0) = -0.055\backslashpm0.068{\$} (a {\$}\backslashsim7{\$}{\%} 1{\$}\backslashsigma{\$} uncertainty) using the Light Curve metric. Including 1{\%} calibration uncertainties in four passbands, adding 4 more parameters, we obtain {\$}\backslashDelta(w{\_}0) = -0.062\backslashpm0.132{\$} (a {\$}\backslashsim14{\$}{\%} 1{\$}\backslashsigma{\$} uncertainty) using the Tripp metric. Overall we find a {\$}17{\$}{\%} increase in the uncertainty on {\$}w{\_}0{\$} with systematics compared to without. We contrast this with a MCMC approach where systematic effects are approximately included. We find that the MCMC method slightly underestimates the impact of calibration uncertainties for this simulated data set.},

abstract = {We study the stellar populations of SNe Ia host galaxies using SDSS-II spectroscopy. We focus on the relationships of SNe Ia properties with stellar velocity dispersion and the stellar population parameters age, metallicity and element abundance ratios derived by fitting absorption line indices to stellar population models. We concentrate on a sub-sample of 84 SNe Ia from the SDSS-II Supernova Survey. In agreement with previous findings, we find that SALT2 stretch factor values show the strongest dependence on stellar population age. Hence, SNe Ia peak-luminosity is closely related to the age of the stellar progenitor systems, where more luminous SNe Ia appear in younger stellar populations. We find no statistically significant trends in the Hubble residual with any of the stellar population parameters studied, including age and metallicity contrary to the literature, as well as with stellar velocity dispersion. Moreover, we find that the method of stellar mass derivation is affecting the Hubble residual-mass relationship when lower number statistics are used. We extend the sample to also include SNe Ia with available SDSS host galaxy photometry only. For this larger sample (247 objects) the reported Hubble residual-mass relation is strongly dependent on the stellar mass range studied and behaves as a step function. In the high mass regime, probed by our host spectroscopy sample, the relation between Hubble residual and stellar mass is flat. Below a stellar mass of {\~{}}2x10{\^{}}10 Msun, i.e. close to the evolutionary transition mass of low-redshift galaxies reported in the literature, the trend changes dramatically such that lower mass galaxies possess lower luminosity SNe Ia after light-curve corrections. This non-linear behaviour of the Hubble residual-mass relationship should be accounted for when using stellar mass as a further parameter for minimising the Hubble residuals.},

abstract = {Recent studies found a correlation with {\$}\backslashsim{\$}3 sigma significance between the local star formation measured by GALEX in Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) host galaxies and the distances or dispersions derived from these SNe. We search for these effects by using data from recent cosmological analyses to greatly increase the SN Ia sample; we include 179 GALEX-imaged SN Ia hosts with distances from the JLA and Pan-STARRS SN Ia cosmology samples and 157 GALEX-imaged SN Ia hosts with distances from the Riess et al. (2011) H{\$}{\_}0{\$} measurement. We find little evidence that SNe Ia in locally star-forming environments are fainter after light curve correction than SNe Ia in locally passive environments. We find a difference of only 0.000{\$}\backslashpm{\$}0.018 (stat+sys) mag for SNe fit with SALT2 and 0.029{\$}\backslashpm{\$}0.027 (stat+sys) mag for SNe fit with MLCS2k2 (R{\$}{\_}V{\$} = 2.5), which suggests that proposed changes to recent measurements of H{\$}{\_}0{\$} and w are not significant and numerically smaller than the parameter measurement uncertainties. We find the greatly reduced significance of these distance modulus differences compared to Rigault et al. (2013) and Rigault et al. (2015) result from two improvements with fairly equal effects, our larger sample size and the use of JLA and Riess et al. (2011) sample selection criteria. Without these improvements, we recover the results of Rigault et al. (2015). We find that both populations have more similar dispersion in distance than found by Rigault et al. (2013), Rigault et al. (2015), and Kelly et al. (2015), with slightly smaller dispersion for locally passive SNe Ia fit with MLCS, the opposite of the effect seen by Rigault et al. (2015) and Kelly et al. (2015). We caution that measuring local SNe Ia environments in the future may require a higher-resolution instrument than GALEX and that SN sample selection has a significant effect on local star formation biases.},

abstract = {Theoretical and observational cosmology have enjoyed a number of significant successes over the last two decades. Cosmic microwave background measurements from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe and Planck, together with large-scale structure and supernova (SN) searches, have put very tight constraints on cosmological parameters. Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) played a central role in the discovery of the accelerated expansion of the Universe, recognised by the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2011. The last decade has seen an enormous increase in the amount of high quality SN observations, with SN catalogues now containing hundreds of objects. This number is expected to increase to thousands in the next few years, as data from next-generation missions, such as the Dark Energy Survey and Large Synoptic Survey Telescope become available. In order to exploit the vast amount of forthcoming high quality data, it is extremely important to develop robust and efficient statistical analysis methods to answer cosmological questions, most notably determining the nature of dark energy. To address these problems my work is based on nested-sampling approaches to parameter estimation and model selection and neural networks for machine-learning. Using advanced Bayesian techniques, I constrain the properties of dark-matter haloes along the SN lines-of-sight via their weak gravitational lensing effects, develop methods for classifying SNe photometrically from their lightcurves, and present results on more general issues associated with constraining cosmological parameters and testing the consistency of different SN compilations.},

abstract = {I describe a Bayesian method to account for measurement errors in linear regression of astronomical data. The method allows for heteroscedastic and possibly correlated measurement errors and intrinsic scatter in the regression relationship. The method is based on deriving a likelihood function for the measured data, and I focus on the case when the intrinsic distribution of the independent variables can be approximated using a mixture of Gaussian functions. I generalize the method to incorporate multiple independent variables, nondetections, and selection effects (e.g., Malmquist bias). A Gibbs sampler is described for simulating random draws from the probability distribution of the parameters, given the observed data. I use simulation to compare the method with other common estimators. The simulations illustrate that the Gaussian mixture model outperforms other common estimators and can effectively give constraints on the regression parameters, even when the measurement errors dominate the observed scatter, source detection fraction is low, or the intrinsic distribution of the independent variables is not a mixture of Gaussian functions. I conclude by using this method to fit the X-ray spectral slope as a function of Eddington ratio using a sample of 39 z{\textless}{\~{}}0.8 radio-quiet quasars. I confirm the correlation seen by other authors between the radio-quiet quasar X-ray spectral slope and the Eddington ratio, where the X-ray spectral slope softens as the Eddington ratio increases.

These nearby SNe were discovered largely by searches targeting luminous galaxies, and we find that their host galaxies are substantially more massive than the hosts of SNe discovered by the flux-limited Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS). Testing four separate light curve fitters, we detect {\~{}}2.5$\sigma$ correlations of Hubble residuals with both host galaxy size and stellar mass, such that SNe Ia occurring in physically larger, more massive hosts are {\~{}}10{\%} brighter after light curve correction. The Hubble residual is the deviation of the inferred distance modulus to the SN, calculated from its apparent luminosity and light curve properties, away from the expected value at the SN redshift. Marginalizing over linear trends in Hubble residuals with light curve parameters shows that the correlations cannot be attributed to a light-curve-dependent calibration error. Combining 180 higher-redshift ESSENCE, SNLS, and HigherZ SNe with 30 nearby SNe whose host masses are less than 1010.8 M ☉ in a cosmology fit yields 1 + w = 0.22+0.152 –0.108, while a combination where the 30 nearby SNe instead have host masses greater than 1010.8 M ☉ yields 1 + w = –0.03+0.217 –0.143. Progenitor metallicity, stellar population age, and dust extinction correlate with galaxy mass and may be responsible for these systematic effects.

abstract = {We describe the difference imaging pipeline (DiffImg) used to detect transients in deep images from the Dark Energy Survey Supernova program (DES-SN) in its first observing season from Aug 2013 through Feb 2014. DES-SN is a search for transients in which ten 3-deg{\^{}}2 fields are repeatedly observed in the g,r,i,z passbands with a cadence of about 1 week. The observing strategy has been optimized to measure high-quality light curves and redshifts for thousands of Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) with the goal of measuring dark energy parameters. The essential DiffImg functions are to align each search image to a deep reference image, do a pixel-by-pixel subtraction, and then examine the subtracted image for significant positive detections of point-source objects. The vast majority of detections are subtraction artifacts, but after selection requirements and image filtering with an automated scanning program, there are 130 detections per deg{\^{}}2 per observation in each band, of which only 25{\%} are artifacts. Of the 7500 transients discovered by DES-SN in its first observing season, each requiring a detection on at least 2 separate nights, Monte Carlo simulations predict that 27{\%} are expected to be supernova. Another 30{\%} of the transients are artifacts, and most of the remaining transients are AGN and variable stars. Fake SNe Ia are overlaid onto the images to rigorously evaluate detection efficiencies, and to understand the DiffImg performance. The DiffImg efficiency measured with fake SNe agrees well with expectations from a Monte Carlo simulation that uses analytical calculations of the fluxes and their uncertainties. In our 8 "shallow" fields with single-epoch 50{\%} completeness depth 23.5, the SN Ia efficiency falls to 1/2 at redshift z 0.7, in our 2 "deep" fields with mag-depth 24.5, the efficiency falls to 1/2 at z 1.1.},

These data fill in the redshift "desert" between low- and high-redshift SN Ia surveys. We combine the SDSS-II measurements with new distance estimates for published SN data from the ESSENCE survey, the Supernova Legacy Survey, the Hubble Space Telescope, and a compilation of nearby SN Ia measurements. Combining the SN Hubble diagram with measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations from the SDSS Luminous Red Galaxy sample and with CMB temperature anisotropy measurements from WMAP, we estimate the cosmological parameters w and Omega{\_}M, assuming a spatially flat cosmological model (FwCDM) with constant dark energy equation of state parameter, w. For the FwCDM model and the combined sample of 288 SNe Ia, we find w = -0.76 +- 0.07(stat) +- 0.11(syst), Omega{\_}M = 0.306 +- 0.019(stat) +- 0.023(syst) using MLCS2k2 and w = -0.96 +- 0.06(stat) +- 0.12(syst), Omega{\_}M = 0.265 +- 0.016(stat) +- 0.025(syst) using the SALT-II fitter. We trace the discrepancy between these results to a difference in the rest-frame UV model combined with a different luminosity correction from color variations; these differences mostly affect the distance estimates for the SNLS and HST supernovae. We present detailed discussions of systematic errors for both light-curve methods and find that they both show data-model discrepancies in rest-frame {\$}U{\$}-band. For the SALT-II approach, we also see strong evidence for redshift-dependence of the color-luminosity parameter (beta). Restricting the analysis to the 136 SNe Ia in the Nearby+SDSS-II samples, we find much better agreement between the two analysis methods but with larger uncertainties.},

abstract = {We describe a general analysis package for supernova (SN) light curves, called SNANA, that contains a simulation, light curve fitter, and cosmology fitter. The software is designed with the primary goal of using SNe Ia as distance indicators for the determination of cosmological parameters, but it can also be used to study efficiencies for analyses of SN rates, estimate contamination from non-Ia SNe, and optimize future surveys. Several SN models are available within the same software architecture, allowing technical features such as K-corrections to be consistently used among multiple models, and thus making it easier to make detailed comparisons between models. New and improved light-curve models can be easily added. The software works with arbitrary surveys and telescopes and has already been used by several collaborations, leading to more robust and easy-to-use code. This software is not intended as a final product release, but rather it is designed to undergo continual improvements from the community as more is learned about SNe. Below we give an overview of the SNANA capabilities, as well as some of its limitations. Interested users can find software downloads and more detailed information from the manuals at http://www.sdss.org/supernova/SNANA.html .},

abstract = {For spectroscopically confirmed Type Ia supernovae we evaluate models of intrinsic brightness variations with detailed data/Monte Carlo comparisons of the dispersion in the following quantities: Hubble-diagram scatter, color difference ( B – V – c ) between the true B – V color and the fitted color ( c ) from the SALT-II light curve model, and photometric redshift residual. The data sample includes 251 ugriz light curves from the three-season Sloan Digital Sky Survey-II and 191 griz light curves from the Supernova Legacy Survey 3 year data release. We find that the simplest model of a wavelength-independent (coherent) scatter is not adequate, and that to describe the data the intrinsic-scatter model must have wavelength-dependent variations resulting in a {\~{}}0.02 mag scatter in B – V – c . Relatively weak constraints are obtained on the nature of intrinsic scatter because a variety of different models can reasonably describe this photometric data sample. We use Monte Carlo simulations to examine the standard approach of adding a coherent-scatter term in quadrature to the distance-modulus uncertainty in order to bring the reduced $\chi$ 2 to unity when fitting a Hubble diagram. If the light curve fits include model uncertainties with the correct wavelength dependence of the scatter, we find that this approach is valid and that the bias on the dark energy equation-of-state parameter w is much smaller ({\~{}}0.001) than current systematic uncertainties. However, incorrect model uncertainties can lead to a significant bias on the distance moduli, with up to {\~{}}0.05 mag redshift-dependent variation. This bias is roughly reduced in half after applying a Malmquist bias correction. For the recent SNLS3 cosmology results, we estimate that this effect introduces an additional systematic uncertainty on w of {\~{}}0.02, well below the total uncertainty. This uncertainty depends on the choice of viable scatter models and the choice of supernova (SN) samples, and thus this small w -uncertainty is not guaranteed in future cosmology results. For example, the w -uncertainty for SDSS+SNLS (dropping the nearby SNe) increases to {\~{}}0.04.},
annote = {Currently, we are constrained to use ad-hoc methods, such as performing many fits with a randomized unexplained -dispersion matrix, and computing the distributions of cosmological parameters fit to fit (Marriner et al. 2011). The impact of these variations is currently subdominant to the total uncertainty (Kessler et al. 2013; Mosher et al. 2014), but this may not be true in future samples and a precise way to evaluate the cosmological impact is desirable},

abstract = {We present a new technique to create a bin-averaged Hubble Diagram (HD) from photometrically identified SN{\~{}}Ia data. The resulting HD is corrected for selection biases and contamination from core collapse (CC) SNe, and can be used to infer cosmological parameters. This method, called "Bias Corrected Distances" (BCD), includes two fitting stages. The first BCD fitting stage combines a Bayesian likelihood with a Monte Carlo simulation to bias-correct the fitted SALT-II parameters, and also incorporates CC probabilities determined from a machine learning technique. The BCD fit determines 1) a bin-averaged HD (average distance vs. redshift), and 2) the nuisance parameters alpha and beta, which multiply the stretch and color (respectively) to standardize the SN brightness. In the second stage, the bin-averaged HD is fit to a cosmological model where priors can be imposed. We perform high precision tests of the BCD method by simulating large (150,000 event) data samples corresponding to the Dark Energy Survey Supernova Program (DESSN). Our tests include three models of intrinsic scatter, each with two different CC rates. In the BCD fit, the SALT-II nuisance parameters alpha and beta are recovered to within 1{\%} of their true values. In the cosmology fit, we determine the dark energy equation of state parameter w using a fixed value of Omega{\_}M as a prior: averaging over all six tests based on 6 x 150,000 = 950,000 SNe, there is a small w-bias of 0.006 +- 0.002. There is an additional w-uncertainty due to the assumed cosmology in the simulations, after iterating, this uncertainty is roughly equal to sigma{\_}w/7 where sigma{\_}w is the uncertainty of the data. Finally, the BCD fitting code is publicly available in the SNANA package.},

abstract = {New supernova surveys such as the Dark Energy Survey, Pan-STARRS and the LSST will produce an unprecedented number of photometric supernova candidates, most with no spectroscopic data. Avoiding biases in cosmological parameters due to the resulting inevitable contamination from non-Ia supernovae can be achieved with the BEAMS formalism, allowing for fully photometric supernova cosmology studies. Here we extend BEAMS to deal with the case in which the supernovae are correlated by systematic uncertainties. The analytical form of the full BEAMS posterior requires evaluating 2N terms, where N is the number of supernova candidates. This `exponential catastrophe' is computationally unfeasible even for N of order 100. We circumvent the exponential catastrophe by marginalising numerically instead of analytically over the possible supernova types: we augment the cosmological parameters with nuisance parameters describing the covariance matrix and the types of all the supernovae, $\tau$i, that we include in our MCMC analysis. We show that this method deals well even with large, unknown systematic uncertainties without a major increase in computational time, whereas ignoring the correlations can lead to significant biases and incorrect credible contours. We then compare the numerical marginalisation technique with a perturbative expansion of the posterior based on the insight that future surveys will have exquisite light curves and hence the probability that a given candidate is a Type Ia will be close to unity or zero, for most objects. Although this perturbative approach changes computation of the posterior from a 2N problem into an N2 or N3 one, we show that it leads to biases in general through a small number of misclassifications, implying that numerical marginalisation is superior.},

abstract = {We present a new compilation of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), a new data set of low-redshift nearby-Hubble-flow SNe, and new analysis procedures to work with these heterogeneous compilations. This Union compilation of 414 SNe Ia, which reduces to 307 SNe after selection cuts, includes the recent large samples of SNe Ia from the Supernova Legacy Survey and ESSENCE Survey, the older data sets, as well as the recently extended data set of distant supernovae observed with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). A single, consistent, and blind analysis procedure is used for all the various SN Ia subsamples, and a new procedure is implemented that consistently weights the heterogeneous data sets and rejects outliers. We present the latest results from this Union compilation and discuss the cosmological constraints from this new compilation and its combination with other cosmological measurements (CMB and BAO). The constraint we obtain from supernovae on the dark energy density is --{\textgreater}$\Omega$$\Lambda$ = 0.713+ 0.027−0.029(stat)+ 0.036−0.039(sys) , for a flat, $\Lambda$CDM universe. Assuming a constant equation of state parameter, w, the combined constraints from SNe, BAO, and CMB give --{\textgreater}w = − 0.969+ 0.059−0.063(stat)+ 0.063−0.066(sys) . While our results are consistent with a cosmological constant, we obtain only relatively weak constraints on a w that varies with redshift. In particular, the current SN data do not yet significantly constrain w at --{\textgreater}z {\textgreater} 1. With the addition of our new nearby Hubble-flow SNe Ia, these resulting cosmological constraints are currently the tightest available.},

abstract = {Observed data are often contaminated by undiscovered interlopers, leading to biased parameter estimation. Here we present BEAMS (Bayesian estimation applied to multiple species) which signifi- cantly improves on the standard maximum likelihood approach in the case where the probability for each data point being ‘‘pure'' is known. We discuss the application of BEAMS to future type-Ia supernovae (SNIa) surveys, such as LSST, which are projected to deliver over a million supernovae light curves without spectra. The multiband light curves for each candidate will provide a probability of being Ia (pure) but the full sample will be significantly contaminated with other types of supernovae and transients. Given a sample of N supernovae with mean probability, hPi, of being Ia, BEAMS delivers parameter constraints equal to NhPi spectroscopically confirmed SNIa. In addition BEAMS can be simultaneously used to tease apart different families of data and to recover properties of the underlying distributions of those families (e.g. the type-Ibc and II distributions). Hence BEAMS provides a unified classification and parameter estimation methodology which may be useful in a diverse range of problems such as photometric redshift estimation or, indeed, any parameter estimation problem where contamination is an issue.},
annote = {the outliers can dominate the other sources of uncertainty in the fit. Kunz et al. (2007) presented a powerful Bayesian technique for simultaneously modeling the distributions of normal SNe and outliers, but does not confront many complexities of the data, including the luminosity standardizations and selection effects.

Second, like Kunz et al. (2007), we handle outliers with a mixture model, described in Section 2.3, which offers improved robustness

For non-Ia contamination, we use the mixture-model framework of Kunz et al. (2007).

Unfortunately contamination of supernova types is also inevitable for photometric surveys. This has been addressed by the BEAMS (Bayesian Estimation Applied to Multiple Species) formalism for the case of spectroscopic redshifts in various papers [5, 14, 25, 26].


Following [14] and [25] one can take µ✚Ia = µIa + b(z, ϕ) where b(z, ϕ) allows both for the redshift evolution of the non-Ia population and the difference in mean intrinsic luminosity compared with SNIa, parameterised by some unknown hyperparameters ϕ which are fit simultaneously with all the other parameters.},

We rediscover, to high significance, the strong correlation between host galaxy typeand the width of the observed SN light curve, i.e., fainter, quickly declining SNe Ia favor passive host galaxies, while brighter, slowly declining Ia's favor star-forming galaxies. We also find evidence (at between 2 to 3 sigma) that SNe Ia are {\~{}}0.1 magnitudes brighter in passive host galaxies, than in star-forming hosts, after the SN Ia light curves have been standardized using the light curve shape and color variations: This difference in brightness is present in both the SALT2 and MCLS2k2 light curve fitting methodologies. We see evidence for differences in the SN Ia color relationship between passive and star-forming host galaxies, e.g., for the MLCS2k2 technique, we see that SNe Ia in passive hosts favor a dust law of R{\_}V {\~{}}1, while SNe Ia in star-forming hosts require R{\_}V {\~{}}2. The significance of these trends depends on the range of SN colors considered. We demonstrate that these effects can be parameterized using the stellar mass of the host galaxy (with a confidence of {\textgreater}4 sigma) and including this extra parameter provides a better statistical fit to our data.

abstract = {Bayesian graphical models are an efficient tool for modelling complex data and derive self-consistent expressions of the posterior distribution of model parameters. We apply Bayesian graphs to perform statistical analyses of Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) luminosity distance measurements from the joint light-curve analysis (JLA) data set. In contrast to the {\$}\backslashchi{\^{}}2{\$} approach used in previous studies, the Bayesian inference allows us to fully account for the standard-candle parameter dependence of the data covariance matrix. Comparing with {\$}\backslashchi{\^{}}2{\$} analysis results, we find a systematic offset of the marginal model parameter bounds. We demonstrate that the bias is statistically significant in the case of the SN Ia standardization parameters with a maximal 6 {\$}\backslashsigma{\$} shift of the SN light-curve colour correction. In addition, we find that the evidence for a host galaxy correction is now only 2.4 {\$}\backslashsigma{\$}. Systematic offsets on the cosmological parameters remain small, but may increase by combining constraints from complementary cosmological probes. The bias of the {\$}\backslashchi{\^{}}2{\$} analysis is due to neglecting the parameter-dependent log-determinant of the data covariance, which gives more statistical weight to larger values of the standardization parameters. We find a similar effect on compressed distance modulus data. To this end, we implement a fully consistent compression method of the JLA data set that uses a Gaussian approximation of the posterior distribution for fast generation of compressed data. Overall, the results of our analysis emphasize the need for a fully consistent Bayesian statistical approach in the analysis of future large SN Ia data sets.},

abstract = {Astronomy light curves are sparse, gappy, and heteroscedastic. As a result standard time series methods regularly used for financial and similar datasets are of little help and astronomers are usually left to their own instruments and techniques to classify light curves. A common approach is to derive statistical features from the time series and to use machine learning methods, generally supervised, to separate objects into a few of the standard classes. In this work, we transform the time series to two-dimensional light curve representations in order to classify them using modern deep learning techniques. In particular, we show that convolutional neural networks based classifiers work well for broad characterization and classification. We use labeled datasets of periodic variables from CRTS survey and show how this opens doors for a quick classification of diverse classes with several possible exciting extensions.},

abstract = {We have constructed a comprehensive statistical model for Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) light curves spanning optical through near-infrared (NIR) data. A hierarchical framework coherently models multiple random and uncertain effects, including intrinsic supernova (SN) light curve covariances, dust extinction and reddening, and distances. An improved BAYESN Markov Chain Monte Carlo code computes probabilistic inferences for the hierarchical model by sampling the global probability density of parameters describing individual SNe and the population. We have applied this hierarchical model to optical and NIR data of 127 SNe Ia from PAIRITEL, CfA3, Carnegie Supernova Project, and the literature. We find an apparent population correlation between the host galaxy extinction AV and the ratio of total-to-selective dust absorption RV . For SNe with low dust extinction, AV {\textless}{\~{}} 0.4, we find RV ≈ 2.5-2.9, while at high extinctions, AV {\textgreater}{\~{}} 1, low values of RV {\textless} 2 are favored. The NIR luminosities are excellent standard candles and are less sensitive to dust extinction. They exhibit low correlation with optical peak luminosities, and thus provide independent information on distances. The combination of NIR and optical data constrains the dust extinction and improves the predictive precision of individual SN Ia distances by about 60{\%}. Using cross-validation, we estimate an rms distance modulus prediction error of 0.11 mag for SNe with optical and NIR data versus 0.15 mag for SNe with optical data alone. Continued study of SNe Ia in the NIR is important for improving their utility as precise and accurate cosmological distance indicators.},

abstract = {Conventional Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) cosmology analyses currently use a simplistic linear regression of magnitude versus color and light curve shape, which does not model intrinsic SN Ia variations and host galaxy dust as physically distinct effects, resulting in low color-magnitude slopes. We construct a probabilistic generative model for the dusty distribution of extinguished absolute magnitudes and apparent colors as the convolution of a intrinsic SN Ia color-magnitude distribution and a host galaxy dust reddening-extinction distribution. If the intrinsic color-magnitude ({\$}M{\_}B{\$} vs. {\$}B-V{\$}) slope {\$}\backslashbeta{\_}{\{}int{\}}{\$} differs from the host galaxy dust law {\$}R{\_}B{\$}, this convolution results in a specific curve of mean extinguished absolute magnitude vs. apparent color. The derivative of this curve smoothly transitions from {\$}\backslashbeta{\_}{\{}int{\}}{\$} in the blue tail to {\$}R{\_}B{\$} in the red tail of the apparent color distribution. The conventional linear fit approximates this effective curve near the average apparent color, resulting in an apparent slope {\$}\backslashbeta{\_}{\{}app{\}}{\$} between {\$}\backslashbeta{\_}{\{}int{\}}{\$} and {\$}R{\_}B{\$}. We incorporate these effects into a hierarchical Bayesian statistical model for SN Ia light curve measurements, and analyze a dataset of SALT2 optical light curve fits of 248 nearby SN Ia at z {\textless} 0.10. The conventional linear fit obtains {\$}\backslashbeta{\_}{\{}app{\}} \backslashapprox 3{\$}. Our model finds a {\$}\backslashbeta{\_}{\{}int{\}} = 2.3 \backslashpm 0.3{\$} and a distinct dust law of {\$}R{\_}B = 3.8 \backslashpm 0.3{\$}, consistent with the average for Milky Way dust, while correcting a systematic distance bias of {\$}\backslashsim 0.10{\$} mag in the tails of the apparent color distribution. Finally, we extend our model to examine the SN Ia luminosity-host mass dependence in terms of intrinsic and dust components.},

abstract = {We present a comprehensive statistical analysis of the properties of Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) light curves in the near-infrared using recent data from Peters Automated InfraRed Imaging TELescope and the literature. We construct a hierarchical Bayesian framework, incorporating several uncertainties including photometric error, peculiar velocities, dust extinction, and intrinsic variations, for principled and coherent statistical inference. SN Ia light-curve inferences are drawn from the global posterior probability of parameters describing both individual supernovae and the population conditioned on the entire SN Ia NIR data set. The logical structure of the hierarchical model is represented by a directed acyclic graph. Fully Bayesian analysis of the model and data is enabled by an efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm exploiting the conditional probabilistic structure using Gibbs sampling. We apply this framework to the JHKs SN Ia light-curve data. A new light-curve model captures the observed J-band light-curve shape variations. The marginal intrinsic variances in peak absolute magnitudes are $\sigma$(MJ ) = 0.17 ± 0.03, $\sigma$(MH ) = 0.11 ± 0.03, and $\sigma$(MKs ) = 0.19 ± 0.04. We describe the first quantitative evidence for correlations between the NIR absolute magnitudes and J-band light-curve shapes, and demonstrate their utility for distance estimation. The average residual in the Hubble diagram for the training set SNe at cz {\textgreater} 2000kms-1 is 0.10 mag. The new application of bootstrap cross-validation to SN Ia light-curve inference tests the sensitivity of the statistical model fit to the finite sample and estimates the prediction error at 0.15 mag. These results demonstrate that SN Ia NIR light curves are as effective as corrected optical light curves, and, because they are less vulnerable to dust absorption, they have great potential as precise and accurate cosmological distance indicators.},

The standard chi-square methodology and the recently proposed Bayesian hierarchical method (BHM) are each applied to identical sets of simulations based on the 3-year data release from the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS3), and also data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), the Low Redshift sample and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), assuming a concordance LCDM cosmology. For both methods, we find that the recovered values of the cosmological parameters, and the global nuisance parameters controlling the stretch and colour corrections to the supernovae lightcurves, suffer from small biasses. The magnitude of the biasses is similar in both cases, with the BHM yielding slightly more accurate results, in particular for cosmological parameters when applied to just the SNLS3 single survey data sets. Most notably, in this case, the biasses in the recovered matter density {\$}\backslashOmega{\_}{\{}\backslashrm m,0{\}}{\$} are in opposite directions for the two methods. For any given realisation of the SNLS3-type data, this can result in a {\$}\backslashsim 2 \backslashsigma{\$} discrepancy in the estimated value of {\$}\backslashOmega{\_}{\{}\backslashrm m,0{\}}{\$} between the two methods, which we find to be the case for real SNLS3 data.

abstract = {We present the spectroscopy from 5254 galaxies that hosted supernovae (SNe) or other transient events in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey II (SDSS-II). Obtained during SDSS-I, SDSS-II, and the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey, this sample represents the largest systematic, unbiased, magnitude limited spectroscopic survey of SN host galaxies. Using the host galaxy redshifts, we test the impact of photometric SN classification based on SDSS imaging data with and without using spectroscopic redshifts of the host galaxies. Following our suggested scheme, there are a total of 1166 photometrically classified SNe Ia when using a flat redshift prior and 1126 SNe Ia when the host spectroscopic redshift is assumed. For 1024 (87.8{\%}) candidates classified as likely SNe Ia without redshift information, we find that the classification is unchanged when adding the host galaxy redshift. Using photometry from SDSS imaging data and the host galaxy spectra, we also report host galaxy properties for use in future analysis of SN astrophysics. Finally, we investigate the differences in the interpretation of the light curve properties with and without knowledge of the redshift. Without host galaxy redshifts, we find that SALT2 light curve fits are systematically biased toward lower photometric redshift estimates and redder colors in the limit of low signal-to-noise data. The general improvements in performance of the light curve fitter and the increased diversity of the host galaxy sample highlights the importance of host galaxy spectroscopy for current photometric SN surveys such as the Dark Energy Survey and future surveys such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope.},

abstract = {We report measurements of the mass density, Omega{\_}M, and cosmological-constant energy density, Omega{\_}Lambda, of the universe based on the analysis of 42 Type Ia supernovae discovered by the Supernova Cosmology Project. The magnitude-redshift data for these SNe, at redshifts between 0.18 and 0.83, are fit jointly with a set of SNe from the Calan/Tololo Supernova Survey, at redshifts below 0.1, to yield values for the cosmological parameters. All SN peak magnitudes are standardized using a SN Ia lightcurve width-luminosity relation. The measurement yields a joint probability distribution of the cosmological parameters that is approximated by the relation 0.8 Omega{\_}M - 0.6 Omega{\_}Lambda {\~{}}= -0.2 +/- 0.1 in the region of interest (Omega{\_}M {\textless}{\~{}} 1.5). For a flat (Omega{\_}M + Omega{\_}Lambda = 1) cosmology we find Omega{\_}M = 0.28{\{}+0.09,-0.08{\}} (1 sigma statistical) {\{}+0.05,-0.04{\}} (identified systematics). The data are strongly inconsistent with a Lambda = 0 flat cosmology, the simplest inflationary universe model. An open, Lambda = 0 cosmology also does not fit the data well: the data indicate that the cosmological constant is non-zero and positive, with a confidence of P(Lambda {\textgreater} 0) = 99{\%}, including the identified systematic uncertainties. The best-fit age of the universe relative to the Hubble time is t{\_}0 = 14.9{\{}+1.4,-1.1{\}} (0.63/h) Gyr for a flat cosmology. The size of our sample allows us to perform a variety of statistical tests to check for possible systematic errors and biases. We find no significant differences in either the host reddening distribution or Malmquist bias between the low-redshift Calan/Tololo sample and our high-redshift sample. The conclusions are robust whether or not a width-luminosity relation is used to standardize the SN peak magnitudes.},

abstract = {The Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS) has produced a high-quality, homogeneous sample of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) out to redshifts greater than z=1. In its first four years of full operation (to June 2007), the SNLS discovered more than 3000 transient candidates, 373 of which have been confirmed spectroscopically as SNe Ia. Use of these SNe Ia in precision cosmology critically depends on an analysis of the observational biases incurred in the SNLS survey due to the incomplete sampling of the underlying SN Ia population. This paper describes our real-time supernova detection and analysis procedures, and uses detailed Monte Carlo simulations to examine the effects of Malmquist bias and spectroscopic sampling. Such sampling effects are found to become apparent at z{\~{}}0.6, with a significant shift in the average magnitude of the spectroscopically confirmed SN Ia sample towards brighter values for z{\textgreater}0.75. We describe our approach to correct for these selection biases in our three-year SNLS cosmological analysis (SNLS3), and present a breakdown of the systematic uncertainties involved.},

abstract = {We present a measurement of the volumetric Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) rate (SNR{\_}Ia) as a function of redshift for the first four years of data from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS). This analysis includes 286 spectroscopically confirmed and more than 400 additional photometrically identified SNe Ia within the redshift range 0.1{\textless}z{\textless}1.1. The volumetric SNR{\_}Ia evolution is consistent with a rise to z{\~{}}1.0 that follows a power-law of the form (1+z){\^{}}alpha, with alpha=2.11+/-0.28. This evolutionary trend in the SNLS rates is slightly shallower than that of the cosmic star-formation history over the same redshift range. We combine the SNLS rate measurements with those from other surveys that complement the SNLS redshift range, and fit various simple SN Ia delay-time distribution (DTD) models to the combined data. A simple power-law model for the DTD (i.e., proportional to t{\^{}}-beta) yields values from beta=0.98+/-0.05 to beta=1.15+/-0.08 depending on the parameterization of the cosmic star formation history. A two-component model, where SNR{\_}Ia is dependent on stellar mass (Mstellar) and star formation rate (SFR) as SNR{\_}Ia(z)=AxMstellar(z) + BxSFR(z), yields the coefficients A=1.9+/-0.1 SNe/yr/M{\_}solar and B=3.3+/-0.2 SNe/yr/(M{\_}solar/yr). More general two-component models also fit the data well, but single Gaussian or exponential DTDs provide significantly poorer matches. Finally, we split the SNLS sample into two populations by the light curve width (stretch), and show that the general behavior in the rates of faster-declining SNe Ia (0.8{\textless}s{\textless}1.0) is similar, within our measurement errors, to that of the slower objects (1.0{\textless}s{\textless}1.3) out to z{\~{}}0.8.},

abstract = {Absolute magnitudes in the B, V, and I bands are derived for nine well-observed Type Ia supernovae, using host galaxy distances estimated via the surface brightness fluctuations or Tully-Fisher methods. These data indicate that there is a significant intrinsic dispersion in the absolute magnitudes at maximum light of Type Ia supernovae, amounting to +/- 0.8 mag in B, +/- 0.6 mag in V, and +/- 0.5 mag in I. Moreover, the absolute magnitudes appear to be tightly correlated with the initial rate of decline of the B light curve, with the slope of the correlation being steepest in B and becoming progressively flatter in the V and I bands. This implies that the intrinsic B - V colors of Type Ia supernovae at maximum light are not identical, with the fastest declining light curves corresponding to the intrinsically reddest events. Certain spectroscopic properties may also be correlated with the initial decline rate. These results are most simply interpreted as evidence for a range of progenitor masses, although variations in the explosion mechanism are also possible. Considerable care must be exercised in employing Type Ia supernovae as cosmological standard candles, particularly at large redshifts where Malmquist bias could be an important effect.},

This fact is used to calibrate the dependence of the B(max)-V(max) and V(max)-I(max) colors on the light curve decline rate parameter delta-m15, which can, in turn, be used to separately estimate the host galaxy extinction.

abstract = {We present the first results based on Planck measurements of the CMB temperature and lensing-potential power spectra. The Planck spectra at high multipoles are extremely well described by the standard spatially-flat six-parameter LCDM cosmology. In this model Planck data determine the cosmological parameters to high precision. We find a low value of the Hubble constant, H0=67.3+/-1.2 km/s/Mpc and a high value of the matter density parameter, Omega{\_}m=0.315+/-0.017 (+/-1 sigma errors) in excellent agreement with constraints from baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) surveys. Including curvature, we find that the Universe is consistent with spatial flatness to percent-level precision using Planck CMB data alone. We present results from an analysis of extensions to the standard cosmology, using astrophysical data sets in addition to Planck and high-resolution CMB data. None of these models are favoured significantly over standard LCDM. The deviation of the scalar spectral index from unity is insensitive to the addition of tensor modes and to changes in the matter content of the Universe. We find a 95{\%} upper limit of r{\textless}0.11 on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. There is no evidence for additional neutrino-like relativistic particles. Using BAO and CMB data, we find N{\_}eff=3.30+/-0.27 for the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, and an upper limit of 0.23 eV for the summed neutrino mass. Our results are in excellent agreement with big bang nucleosynthesis and the standard value of N{\_}eff=3.046. We find no evidence for dynamical dark energy. Despite the success of the standard LCDM model, this cosmology does not provide a good fit to the CMB power spectrum at low multipoles, as noted previously by the WMAP team. While not of decisive significance, this is an anomaly in an otherwise self-consistent analysis of the Planck temperature data.},

The cosmological fit to 310 SNe Ia (113 PS1 SNe Ia + 222 light curves from 197 low-z SNe Ia), using only supernovae (SNe) and assuming a constant dark energy equation of state and flatness, yields w=-1.120+0.360-0.206{\{}(Stat){\}} +0.269-0.291{\{}(Sys){\}}. When combined with BAO+CMB(Planck)+H 0, the analysis yields $\Omega$ {\_}M=0.280+0.013-0.012 and w=-1.166+0.072-0.069 including all identified systematics. The value of w is inconsistent with the cosmological constant value of -1 at the 2.3$\sigma$ level. Tension endures after removing either the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) or the H 0 constraint, though it is strongest when including the H 0 constraint. If we include WMAP9 cosmic microwave background (CMB) constraints instead of those from Planck, we find w=-1.124+0.083-0.065, which diminishes the discord to {\textless}2$\sigma$. We cannot conclude whether the tension with flat $\Lambda$CDM is a feature of dark energy, new physics, or a combination of chance and systematic errors. The full Pan-STARRS1 SN sample with {\~{}}three times as many SNe should provide more conclusive results.},

abstract = {We present observations of 10 type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) between 0.16 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.62. With previous data from our High-Z Supernova Search Team, this expanded set of 16 high-redshift supernovae and 34 nearby supernovae are used to place constraints on the Hubble constant (H{\_}0), the mass density (Omega{\_}M), the cosmological constant (Omega{\_}Lambda), the deceleration parameter (q{\_}0), and the dynamical age of the Universe (t{\_}0). The distances of the high-redshift SNe Ia are, on average, 10{\%} to 15{\%} farther than expected in a low mass density (Omega{\_}M=0.2) Universe without a cosmological constant. Different light curve fitting methods, SN Ia subsamples, and prior constraints unanimously favor eternally expanding models with positive cosmological constant (i.e., Omega{\_}Lambda {\textgreater} 0) and a current acceleration of the expansion (i.e., q{\_}0 {\textless} 0). With no prior constraint on mass density other than Omega{\_}M {\textgreater} 0, the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia are consistent with q{\_}0 {\textless}0 at the 2.8 sigma and 3.9 sigma confidence levels, and with Omega{\_}Lambda {\textgreater}0 at the 3.0 sigma and 4.0 sigma confidence levels, for two fitting methods respectively. Fixing a ``minimal'' mass density, Omega{\_}M=0.2, results in the weakest detection, Omega{\_}Lambda{\textgreater}0 at the 3.0 sigma confidence level. For a flat-Universe prior (Omega{\_}M+Omega{\_}Lambda=1), the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia require Omega{\_}Lambda {\textgreater}0 at 7 sigma and 9 sigma level for the two fitting methods. A Universe closed by ordinary matter (i.e., Omega{\_}M=1) is ruled out at the 7 sigma to 8 sigma level. We estimate the size of systematic errors, including evolution, extinction, sample selection bias, local flows, gravitational lensing, and sample contamination. Presently, none of these effects reconciles the data with Omega{\_}Lambda=0 and q{\_}0 {\textgreater} 0.},

abstract = {Previously we used the Nearby Supernova Factory sample to show that Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) having locally star-forming environments are dimmer than SNe Ia having locally passive environments. Here we use the Constitution sample together with host galaxy data from GALEX to independently confirm that result. The effect is seen using both the SALT2 and MLCS2k2 lightcurve fitting and standardization methods, with brightness differences of 0.094 ± 0.037 mag for SALT2 and 0.155 ± 0.041 mag for MLCS2k2 with RV = 2.5. When combined with our previous measurement the effect is 0.094 ± 0.025 mag for SALT2. If the ratio of these local SNIa environments changes with redshift or sample selection, this can lead to a bias in cosmological measurements. We explore this issue further, using as an example the direct measurement of H0. GALEX observations show that the SNe Ia having standardized absolute magnitudes calibrated via the Cepheid period–luminosity relation using the Hubble Space Telescope originate in predominately star-forming environments, whereas only ∼50{\%} of the Hubble-flow comparison sample have locally star-forming environments. As a consequence, the H0 measurement usingSNeIa is currently overestimated. Correcting for this bias,we find a value ofHcorr 0 =70.6±2.6km s−1 Mpc−1 when using the LMC distance, Milky Way parallaxes, and the NGC 4258 megamaser as the Cepheid zero point, and 68.8 ± 3.3km s−1 Mpc−1 when only using NGC 4258. Our correction brings the direct measurement of H0 within ∼1 $\sigma$ of recent indirect measurements based on the cosmic microwave background power spectrum},
annote = {This effect, confirmed independently by Rigault et al. (2015), implies that SNe hosted by high-stellar-mass galaxies may become more like low-stellar-mass-hosted SNe at higher redshift (when progenitors were young in all galaxies).

abstract = {(Abridged) We study the host galaxy regions in close proximity to Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) to analyze relations between the properties of SN Ia events and environments most similar to where their progenitors formed. We focus on local H$\backslash$alpha$\backslash$ emission as an indicator of young environments. The Nearby Supernova Factory has obtained flux-calibrated spectral timeseries for SNe Ia using integral field spectroscopy, allowing the simultaneous measurement of the SN and its immediate vicinity. For 89 SNe Ia we measure H$\backslash$alpha$\backslash$ emission tracing ongoing star formation within a 1 kpc radius around each SN. This constitutes the first direct study of the local environment for a large sample of SNe Ia also having accurate luminosity, color and stretch measurements. We find that SNe Ia with local H$\backslash$alpha$\backslash$ emission are redder by 0.036+/-0.017 mag, and that the previously-noted correlation between stretch and host mass is entirely driven by the SNe Ia coming from passive regions. Most importantly, the mean standardized brightness for SNe Ia with local H$\backslash$alpha$\backslash$ emission is 0.094+/-0.031 mag fainter than for those without. This offset arises from a bimodal structure in the Hubble residuals, that also explains the previously-known host-mass bias. We combine this bimodality with the cosmic star-formation rate to predict changes with redshift in the mean SN Ia brightness and the host-mass bias. This change is confirmed using high-redshift SNe Ia from the literature. These environmental dependences point to remaining systematic errors in SNe Ia standardization. The observed brightness offset is predicted to cause a significant bias in measurements of the dark energy equation of state. Recognition of these effects offers new opportunities to improve SNe Ia as cosmological probes - e.g. SNe Ia having local H$\backslash$alpha$\backslash$ emission are more homogeneous, having a brightness dispersion of 0.105+/-0.012 mag.},
annote = {Rigault et al. (2013) found evidence that most of this effect is due to the age of the progenitor system (see also indirect evidence in Childress et al. 2013).

We therefore do not assume a constant mass-standardization ($\delta$); instead we use a modified version of the model in Rigault et al. (2013; similar to the model of Childress et al. 2014)

If the luminosity distribution of SNe Ia turns out to be significantly non-Gaussian (for example,the bimodal model of Rigault et al. 2013), additional Gaussian components can be added (with redshift-dependent normalizations) to give smaller},

abstract = {Supernova cosmology without spectra will be the bread and butter mode for future surveys such as LSST. This lack of supernova spectra results in uncertainty in the redshifts which, if ignored, leads to significantly biased estimates of cosmological parameters. Here we present a hierarchical Bayesian formalism -- zBEAMS -- that fully addresses this problem by marginalising over the unknown or contaminated supernova redshifts to produce unbiased cosmological estimates that are competitive with entirely spectroscopic data. zBEAMS provides a unified treatment of both photometric redshifts and host galaxy misidentification (occurring due to chance galaxy alignments or faint hosts), effectively correcting the inevitable contamination in the Hubble diagram. Like its predecessor BEAMS, our formalism also takes care of non-Ia supernova contamination by marginalising over the unknown supernova type. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique with simulations of supernovae with photometric redshifts and host galaxy misidentification. A novel feature of the photometric redshift case is the important role played by the redshift distribution of the supernovae.},

Within these survey images we discovered 65 supernovae (SN) of all types, out to z{\~{}}2.5. We classify {\~{}}24 of these as Type Ia SN (SN Ia) based on host-galaxy redshifts and SN photometry (supplemented by grism spectroscopy of 6 SN). Here we present a measurement of the volumetric SN Ia rate as a function of redshift, reaching for the first time beyond z=2 and putting new constraints on SN Ia progenitor models. Our highest redshift bin includes detections of SN that exploded when the universe was only {\~{}}3 Gyr old and near the peak of the cosmic star-formation history. This gives the CANDELS high-redshift sample unique leverage for evaluating the fraction of SN Ia that explode promptly after formation ({\textless}500 Myr). Combining the CANDELS rates with all available SN Ia rate measurements in the literature we find that this prompt SN Ia fraction is fP=0.53 +0.09 -0.10 (stat) +0.10 -0.26 (sys), consistent with a delay time distribution that follows a simple t{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}} power law for all times t{\textgreater}40 Myr. However, a mild tension is apparent between ground-based low-z surveys and space-based high-z surveys. In both CANDELS and the sister HST program CLASH, we find a low rate of SN Ia at z{\textgreater}1. This could be a hint that prompt progenitors are in fact relatively rare, accounting for only {\~{}}20{\%} of all SN Ia explosions -- though further analysis and larger samples will be needed to examine that suggestion.},

We present a new Bayesian framework, called UNITY (Unified Nonlinear Inference for Type-Ia cosmologY), that incorporates significant improvements in our ability to confront these effects. We apply the framework to real supernova observations and demonstrate smaller statistical and systematic uncertainties. We verify earlier results that SNe Ia require nonlinear shape and color standardizations, but we now include these nonlinear relations in a statistically well-justified way.

Light curves, spectra, classifications, and ancillary data are presented for 10,258 variable and transient sources discovered through repeat ugriz imaging of SDSS Stripe 82, a 300 deg2 area along the celestial equator. This data release is comprised of all transient sources brighter than r{\~{}}22.5 mag with no history of variability prior to 2004. Dedicated spectroscopic observations were performed on a subset of 889 transients, as well as spectra for thousands of transient host galaxies using the SDSS-III BOSS spectrographs. Photometric classifications are provided for the candidates with good multi-color light curves that were not observed spectroscopically. From these observations, 4607 transients are either spectroscopically confirmed, or likely to be, supernovae, making this the largest sample of supernova candidates ever compiled. We present a new method for SN host-galaxy identification and derive host-galaxy properties including stellar masses, star-formation rates, and the average stellar population ages from our SDSS multi-band photometry. We derive SALT2 distance moduli for a total of 1443 SN Ia with spectroscopic redshifts as well as photometric redshifts for a further 677 purely-photometric SN Ia candidates. Using the spectroscopically confirmed subset of the three-year SDSS-II SN Ia sample and assuming a flat Lambda-CDM cosmology, we determine Omega{\_}M = 0.315 +/- 0.093 (statistical error only) and detect a non-zero cosmological constant at 5.7 sigmas.},

abstract = {We estimate systematic errors due to K-corrections in standard photometric analyses of high-redshift Type Ia supernovae. Errors due to K-correction occur when the spectral template model underlying the light curve fitter poorly represents the actual supernova spectral energy distribution, meaning that the distance modulus cannot be recovered accurately. In order to quantify this effect, synthetic photometry is performed on artificially redshifted spectrophotometric data from 119 low-redshift supernovae from the Nearby Supernova Factory, and the resulting light curves are fit with a conventional light curve fitter. We measure the variation in the standardized magnitude that would be fit for a given supernova if located at a range of redshifts and observed with various filter sets corresponding to current and future supernova surveys. We find significant variation in the measurements of the same supernovae placed at different redshifts regardless of filters used, which causes dispersion greater than {\~{}}0.05 mag for measurements of photometry using the Sloan-like filters and a bias that corresponds to a 0.03 shift in w when applied to an outside data set. To test the result of a shift in supernova population or environment at higher redshifts, we repeat our calculations with the addition of a reweighting of the supernovae as a function of redshift and find that this strongly affects the results and would have repercussions for cosmology. We discuss possible methods to reduce the contribution of the K-correction bias and uncertainty.},

abstract = {We present optical light curves, redshifts, and classifications for 361 spectroscopically confirmed Type Ia supernovae (SNeIa) discovered by the Pan-STARRS1 (PS1) Medium Deep Survey. We detail improvements to the PS1 SN photometry, astrometry and calibration that reduce the systematic uncertainties in the PS1 SN Ia distances. We combine the subset of 276 PS1 SN Ia ({\$}0.03 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.65{\$}) with distance estimates of SN Ia from SDSS, SNLS, various low-z and HST samples to form the largest combined sample of SN Ia consisting of a total of 1049 SN Ia ranging from {\$}0.01 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.3{\$}, which we call the 'Pantheon Sample'. Photometric calibration uncertainties have long dominated the systematic error budget of every major analysis of cosmological parameters with SNIa. We have reduced these calibration systematics to the point where they are similar in size to the other major sources of known systematic uncertainties: the nature of the intrinsic scatter of SNIa and modeling of selection effects. When combining Planck 2015 CMB measurements with the Pantheon SN sample, we find {\$}\backslashOmega{\_}m = 0.306 \backslashpm 0.012{\$} and {\$}w = -1.031 \backslashpm 0.040{\$} for the wCDMmodel. When the SN and CMB constraints are combined with constraints from BAO and local H0 measurements, the analysis yields the most precise measurement of dark energy to date: {\$}w{\_}0 = -1.011 \backslashpm 0.087{\$} and {\$}w{\_}a = -0.215 \backslashpm 0.402{\$} for the w0waCDM model. Tension with a cosmological constant previously seen in an analysis of PS1 and low-z SNe has diminished after an increase of {\$}2\backslashtimes{\$} in the statistics of the PS1 sample, improved calibration and photometry, and stricter light-curve quality cuts. We find the systematic uncertainties in our measurements of dark energy are almost as large as the statistical uncertainties, primarily due to limitations of modeling the low-redshift sample. This must be addressed for future progress in using SN Ia to measure dark energy.},

abstract = {We probe the systematic uncertainties from the 113 Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) in the Pan-STARRS1 (PS1) sample along with 197 SN Ia from a combination of low-redshift surveys. The companion paper by Rest et al. describes the photometric measurements and cosmological inferences from the PS1 sample. The largest systematic uncertainty stems from the photometric calibration of the PS1 and low-z samples. We increase the sample of observed Calspec standards from 7 to 10 used to define the PS1 calibration system. The PS1 and SDSS-II calibration systems are compared and discrepancies up to ∼0.02 mag are recovered. We find uncertainties in the proper way to treat intrinsic colors and reddening produce differences in the recovered value of w up to 3{\%}. We estimate masses of host galaxies of PS1 supernovae and detect an insignificant difference in distance residuals of the full sample of 0.037 ± 0.031 mag for host galaxies with high and low masses. Assuming flatness and including systematic uncertainties in our analysis of only SNe measurements, we find w =−1.120 +0.360 −0.206 (Stat) +0.269 −0.291 (Sys). With additional constraints from Baryon acoustic oscillation, cosmic microwave background (CMB) (Planck) and H 0 measurements, we find w = −1.166 +0.072 −0.069 and $\Omega$ m = 0.280 +0.013 −0.012 (statistical and systematic errors added in quadrature).

abstract = {Past analyses of Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) have identified an irreducible scatter of 5-10{\%} in distance widely attributed to an intrinsic dispersion in luminosity. Another, equally valid, source of this scatter is intrinsic dispersion in color. Misidentification of the true source of this scatter can bias both the retrieved color-luminosity relation and cosmological parameter measurements. The size of this bias depends on the magnitude of the intrinsic color dispersion relative to the distribution of colors that correlate with distance. We produce a realistic simulation of a misattribution of intrinsic scatter, and find a negative bias in the recovered color-luminosity relation, beta, of dbeta -1.0 ({\~{}}33{\%}) and a positive bias in the equation of state parameter, w, of dw +0.04 ({\~{}}4{\%}). We re-analyze current published data sets with the assumptions that the distance scatter is predominantly the result of color. Unlike previous analyses, we find that the data are consistent with a Milky Way reddening law R{\_}V=3.1, and that a Milky Way dust model better predicts the asymmetric color-luminosity trends than the conventional luminosity scatter hypothesis. We also determine that accounting for color variation reduces the correlation between various Host galaxy properties and Hubble residuals by {\~{}}20{\%}.},

abstract = {Simulations of Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa) surveys are a critical tool for correcting biases in the analysis of SNIa to infer cosmological parameters. Large scale Monte Carlo simulations include a thorough treatment of observation history, measurement noise, intrinsic scatter models and selection effects. In this paper, we improve simulations with a robust technique to evaluate the underlying populations of SNIa color and stretch that correlate with luminosity. In typical analyses, the standardized SNIa brightness is determined from linear `Tripp' relations between the light curve color and luminosity and between stretch and luminosity. However, this solution produces Hubble residual biases because intrinsic scatter and measurement noise result in measured color and stretch values that do not follow the Tripp relation. We find a {\$}10\backslashsigma{\$} bias (up to 0.3 mag) in Hubble residuals versus color and {\$}5\backslashsigma{\$} bias (up to 0.2 mag) in Hubble residuals versus stretch in a joint sample of 920 spectroscopically confirmed SNIa from PS1, SNLS, SDSS and several low-z surveys. After we determine the underlying color and stretch distributions, we use simulations to predict and correct the biases in the data. We show that removing these biases has a small impact on the low-z sample, but reduces the intrinsic scatter {\$}\backslashsigma{\_}{\{}\backslashtextrm{\{}int{\}}{\}}{\$} from {\$}0.101{\$} to {\$}0.083{\$} in the combined PS1, SNLS and SDSS sample. Past estimates of the underlying populations were too broad, leading to a small bias in the equation-of-state of dark energy {\$}w{\$} of {\$}\backslashDelta w=0.005{\$}.},

abstract = {(Abridged) Precision cosmology with Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) makes use of the fact that SN Ia luminosities depend on their light-curve shapes and colours. Using Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS) and other data, we show that there is an additional dependence on the global characteristics of their host galaxies: events of the same light-curve shape and colour are, on average, 0.08mag ({\~{}}4.0sigma) brighter in massive host galaxies (presumably metal-rich) and galaxies with low specific star-formation rates (sSFR). SNe Ia in galaxies with a low sSFR also have a smaller slope ("beta") between their luminosities and colours with {\~{}}2.7sigma significance, and a smaller scatter on SN Ia Hubble diagrams (at 95{\%} confidence), though the significance of these effects is dependent on the reddest SNe. SN Ia colours are similar between low-mass and high-mass hosts, leading us to interpret their luminosity differences as an intrinsic property of the SNe and not of some external factor such as dust. If the host stellar mass is interpreted as a metallicity indicator, the luminosity trends are in qualitative agreement with theoretical predictions. We show that the average stellar mass, and therefore the average metallicity, of our SN Ia host galaxies decreases with redshift. The SN Ia luminosity differences consequently introduce a systematic error in cosmological analyses, comparable to the current statistical uncertainties on parameters such as w. We show that the use of two SN Ia absolute magnitudes, one for events in high-mass (metal-rich) galaxies, and one for events in low-mass (metal-poor) galaxies, adequately corrects for the differences. Cosmological fits incorporating these terms give a significant reduction in chi{\^{}}2 (3.8-4.5sigma). We conclude that future SN Ia cosmological analyses should use a correction of this (or similar) form to control demographic shifts in the galaxy population.},

The SNe Ia were discovered over the redshift interval 0.623 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.415. Of these SNe Ia, 14 pass our strict selection cuts and are used in combination with the world's sample of SNe Ia to derive the best current constraints on dark energy. Of our new SNe Ia, 10 are beyond redshift z = 1, thereby nearly doubling the statistical weight of HST-discovered SNe Ia beyond this redshift. Our detailed analysis corrects for the recently identified correlation between SN Ia luminosity and host galaxy mass and corrects the NICMOS zero point at the count rates appropriate for very distant SNe Ia. Adding these SNe improves the best combined constraint on dark-energy density, $\rho$DE(z), at redshifts 1.0 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.6 by 18{\%} (including systematic errors). For a flat $\Lambda$CDM universe, we find $\Omega$$\Lambda$ = 0.729 ± 0.014 (68{\%} confidence level (CL) including systematic errors). For a flat wCDM model, we measure a constant dark-energy equation-of-state parameter w = -1.013+0.068 -0.073 (68{\%} CL). Curvature is constrained to {\~{}}0.7{\%} in the owCDM model and to {\~{}}2{\%} in a model in which dark energy is allowed to vary with parameters w 0 and wa . Further tightening the constraints on the time evolution of dark energy will require several improvements, including high-quality multi-passband photometry of a sample of several dozen z {\textgreater} 1 SNe Ia.

abstract = {If, in addition to the usual luminosity correction described by the light curve slope parameter b, we introduce a color correction parameter R, then an extraordinarily good fit is realized for all the 29 distant Type Ia supernovae of the recent Calacutea n/Tololo supernova survey. The reduced chi (2) found is much lower than can be expected. All of the intrinsic dispersion is thereby removed from the data sample, leaving perfectly standardized candles insofar as one can measure with present techniques. The best-fit solution has a mysteriously low value for R (referred to the B-band) of about 2 and a value of b {\~{}} 0.5 which is smaller than previously reported without the color correction. These parameters lead, using pre-Hipparcos distances for Cepheid calibrations, to essentially the same value for the Hubble constant. Our preliminary value, subject to further investigation of Cepheid-calibrated supernovae using this same color correction, is H{\{}0 = 60 +/- 6 $\backslash$ kms(-1) Mpc(-1{\}}) .

abstract = {We use a sample of 1338 spectroscopically confirmed and photometrically classified Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia), sourced from the CSP, CfA, SDSS-II, and SNLS supernova samples, to examine the relationships between SNe Ia and the galaxies that host them. Our results provide confirmation with improved statistical significance that SNe Ia, after standardization, are on average more luminous in massive hosts (significance {\$}\backslashrm {\textgreater} 5 \backslashsigma{\$}), and decline more rapidly in massive hosts (significance {\$}\backslashrm {\textgreater} 9\backslashsigma{\$}) and in hosts with low specific star formation rates (significance {\$}\backslashrm {\textgreater} 8\backslashsigma{\$}). We study the variation of these relationships with redshift and detect no evolution. We split SNe Ia into pairs of subsets that are based on the properties of the hosts, and fit cosmological models to each subset. Including both systematic and statistical uncertainties, we do not find any significant shift in the best-fit cosmological parameters between the subsets. Among different SN Ia subsets, we find that SNe Ia in hosts with high specific star formation rates have the least intrinsic scatter ({\$}\backslashrm \backslashsigma{\_}{\{}int{\}}=0.08\backslashpm0.01{\$}) in luminosity after standardization.},

@article{Weyant2013,
abstract = {Cosmological inference becomes increasingly difficult when complex data-generating processes cannot be modelled by simple probability distributions. With the ever-increasing size of data sets in cosmology, there is increasing burden placed on adequate modelling; systematic errors in the model will dominate where previously these were swamped by statistical errors. For example, Gaussian distributions are an insufficient representation for errors in quantities like photometric redshifts. Likewise, it can be difficult to quantify analytically the distribution of errors that are introduced in complex fitting codes. Without a simple form for these distributions, it becomes difficult to accurately construct a likelihood function for the data as a function of parameters of interest. Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) provides a means of probing the posterior distribution when direct calculation of a sufficiently accurate likelihood is intractable. ABC allows one to bypass direct calculation of the likelihood but instead relies upon the ability to simulate the forward process that generated the data. These simulations can naturally incorporate priors placed on nuisance parameters, and hence these can be marginalized in a natural way. We present and discuss ABC methods in the context of supernova cosmology.},

abstract = {The Australian Dark Energy Survey (OzDES) is a five-year, 100-night, spectroscopic survey on the Anglo-Australian Telescope, whose primary aim is to measure redshifts of approximately 2500 Type Ia supernovae host galaxies over the redshift range 0.1 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.2, and derive reverberation-mapped black hole masses for approximately 500 active galactic nuclei and quasars over 0.3 {\textless} z {\textless} 4.5. This treasure trove of data forms a major part of the spectroscopic follow-up for the Dark Energy Survey for which we are also targeting cluster galaxies, radio galaxies, strong lenses, and unidentified transients, as well as measuring luminous red galaxies and emission line galaxies to help calibrate photometric redshifts. Here, we present an overview of the OzDES programme and our first-year results. Between 2012 December and 2013 December, we observed over 10 000 objects and measured more than 6 000 redshifts. Our strategy of retargeting faint objects across many observing runs has allowed us to measure redshifts for galaxies as faint as mr = 25 mag. We outline our target selection and observing strategy, quantify the redshift success rate for different types of targets, and discuss the implications for our main science goals. Finally, we highlight a few interesting objects as examples of the fortuitous yet not totally unexpected discoveries that can come from such a large spectroscopic survey.},
